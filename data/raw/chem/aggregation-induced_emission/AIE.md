## Usage Notes

- One publication may belong to multiple categories.
- Recommended format for tagging literature:
  
  Example:
  Emergence-type AIE + TSI + CTE + Crystalline aggregate +
  Small-molecule AIEgen + RTP

- This framework integrates classical AIE mechanisms with
  modern aggregate-science concepts.
