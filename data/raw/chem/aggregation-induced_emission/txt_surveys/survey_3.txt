ABSTRACT: Photoresponsive polymers have become one of the
most important smart materials due to their unique advantages such
as excellent sensitivity, high contrast, and rapid response. Endowing
photoresponsive polymers with aggregation-induced emission (AIE)
can not only enrich the research of materials science but also expand
the applications of smart materials. Photoresponsive AIE polymers
are generally constructed by combining AIE luminogens (AIEgens)
with photoresponsive units via chemical, supramolecular, or physical
strategies. In terms of the working mechanisms, two main responsive
systems, namely, photochemical and photophysical, are summarized
with speci ﬁc application examples. Photoresponsive AIE polymers
have been applied not only in chemosensors, photopatterning, and
photodegradable materials but also in biosystems for photodynamic
therapy, photothermal therapy, photoacoustic imaging, and photobiosynthesis. This Review concludes with a discussion on the
challenges and perspectives for future directions in this ﬁeld. All the achievements and advantages mentioned in this Review indicate
the fascinating properties and bright future of photoresponsive AIE polymers.

1. INTRODUCTION
Smart materials are new types of functional materials that can
perceive external stimulations and then judge and respond
appropriately by themselves. 1,2 They are one of the most
important directions for the development of modern intelligent
materials in the information age.
3 Although there is still no
uniﬁed de ﬁnition, smart materials are generally called
responsive materials with the following characteristics: (1)
perceptiveness, i.e., able to detect and recognize the intensity
of external or internal stimuli, such as electricity,
4 light,5 heat,6
magnetism,7 mechanical force, 8 solvent,9 pH,10 chemistry,11
nuclear radiation, 12 etc., (2) targeted conversion, i.e., able to
convert the input stimulus signal into the targeted output
response signal through speci ﬁc mechanisms/pathways, (3)
responsiveness, i.e., capable of responding to stimuli through
timely changes in physical/chemical properties.
13−15 Among
all these stimuli, light is the most unique stimulus due to its
special properties such as precise stimulation and response,
remote nonintrusive control, and environmental friendliness.
Photoresponsive materials undergo either a photochemical or
photophysical mechanism to convert the light stimulation into
a chemistry reaction, sound, light, heat, electricity, force, and
other forms of energy.
5 They have been found in various
applications such as photoresponsive chemosensors, 16 photo-
patterning,17 photodegradation,18 photodynamic therapy, 19
photodriven desalination, 20 photothermal therapy, 21 and
photoacoustic imaging. 22 The huge potential opportunity
oﬀered by photoresponsive polymers has created a signi ﬁcant
increase in their research and practical applications by both
scientists and technologists.
Most traditional photoresponsive materials exhibit light
responsive properties only in solution. However, for practical
applications, the materials are often utilized in the solid or
aggregate state.
23−25 In the solid/aggregate state, the proper-
ties of a molecule are usually di ﬀerent from those in solution.
For example, photoresponsive systems utilizing ﬂuorescence as
output signals are one of the most widely studied systems for
their simple detection method, visible and timely response, and
high sensitivity. In the aggregate state, these systems
commonly su ﬀer from lower/non ﬂuorescence intensity and
photobleaching caused by the aggregation-induced quenching
(ACQ) e ﬀect, which strongly hinders their practical
applications.
26−29 It is thus critical to develop new photo-
responsive systems to address these problems in the aggregate
state.

In 1853, George Stokes observed an unusual luminescence
phenomenon in platinocyanides that was the exact opposite of
ACQ.
30 However, this occasional phenomenon did not attract
the attention of scientists until Tang and co-workers reported
the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) of a silole derivative
called 1-methyl-1,2,3,4,5-pentaphenylsilole in 2001.
31 AIE
luminogens (AIEgens) are generally nonemissive or faintly
emissive in a dilute solution but emit strong ﬂuorescence in a
concentrated solution or aggregate/solid state. So far, the most
acceptable mechanism of the AIE phenomenon is the
restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM).
32,33 According
to the RIM mechanism, AIEgens are dissolved in solution as
isolated molecules, which facilitates the intramolecular motions
and dramatically consumes the excitation energy through
nonradiative decay. In aggregates, the distance between
molecules decreases sharply, and such a physical construct
signiﬁcantly restricts the intramolecular motions of AIEgens
and allows the excited state to relax through the radiative decay
pathways. The RIM mechanism has promoted the design and
development of myriad AIEgens with diverse molecular
structures and physicochemical properties.

applications of materials by enhancing the light conversion
eﬃ ciency and sensitivity. The introduction of AIEgens with a
signal amplifying e ﬀect into photoresponsive materials is thus
conducive to the design of new sophisticated photoresponse
systems with higher resolution, stronger response signal, and
lower response threshold.
42,43
Among the photoresponsive AIE systems, polymeric
materials show excellent processability, impressive mechanical
robustness, and high stability.
44 Compared with small
molecular luminogens, photoresponsive polymers show the
following advantages. First, the small molecular luminogens
show poor processability, while the polymers generally show
excellent processability and mechanical strength, making the
photoresponsive AIE polymers more suitable for diverse
applications. Second, the intramolecular and intermolecular
interactions of AIE polymers endow them with synergistic
eﬀects, which endows them superior properties and perform-
ance, such as stronger reactive oxygen generation ability.
45
Third, conjugated polymers generally show higher absorptivity,
better photostability, and larger Stokes shift due to highly
delocalized π-conjugated backbones, which enables them to be
a good candidate for photoacoustic imaging. Finally, the
photoresponsive polymers show easier surface functionaliza-
tion than small molecular luminogens, which makes them ideal
materials for photocontrolled drug delivery, biomedical
research, encapsulation of ﬂuorescent nanoparticles, and so
on.
46 The combination of the photoresponsive AIE feature
with polymers can not only enrich the basic research of
materials science but also create new materials for high-tech
applications and thus have attracted wide attention in recent
years.
47−49 In this Review, we summarize the previous work
systematically and look forward to the future development
direction of this ﬁeld. To o ﬀer readers a more comprehensive
understanding, especially the structure −application relation-
ship, we ﬁrst summarized the current construction methods of
photoresponsive AIE polymers, including chemical, supra-
molecular, and physical strategies. Then, on the basis of
diﬀerent light-responsive mechanisms, we further classi ﬁed the
existing photoresponsive AIE polymers into two main types,
namely, photochemical responsive and photophysical respon-
sive systems. In each section, we summarized the general
working mechanisms and examples for speci ﬁc applications. In
the last part, we conclude this Review by discussing the
challenges and o ﬀering several perspectives on future
directions.
2. CONSTRUCTION OF PHOTORESPONSIVE AIE
POLYMERS
The photoresponsive AIE polymers are generally constructed
by incorporating AIEgens and photoresponsive units (PRUs)
into the polymer structure. On the basis of the interaction
between the functional group and the polymer structure, these
photoresponsive AIE polymeric systems can be classi ﬁed into
chemical, supramolecular, or physical strategies. In chemical
strategies, the AIEgens and PRUs are incorporated into the
polymer backbone or side chain by covalent bonds. The
copolymerizations of AIEgens with difunctional ( Scheme 1 A)
and monofunctional ( Scheme 1B) photoresponsive monomers
are the most widely used approaches. The chemical linkage of
photoresponsive units to AIE polymers via postmodi ﬁcation

(Scheme 1 C) can also generate photoresponsive AIE
p o l y m e r s .I ns o m ec a s e s ,p o l y m e r sw i t ht h eA I Ea n d
photoresponsive e ﬀect can be in situ constructed from AIE/
photoresponsive-inactive monomers ( Scheme 1 D). Besides
covalent interactions, noncovalent interactions, such as host −
guest interactions ( Scheme 1 E) and hydrogen bonding
(Scheme 1 F), can also be used to synthesize photoresponsive
polymers with the AIE e ﬀect. Meanwhile, the physical doping
and encapsulation ( Scheme 1 G) of photoresponsive AIEgens
by preformed polymers are the most widely used and simple
way to generate photoresponsive AIE polymers.
2.1. Chemical Strategies. Chemical strategies are
frequently utilized for constructing photoresponsive AIE
polymers
50 in which the AIE e ﬀect is mostly originated from
the embedded AIE moieties such as tetraphenylethene (TPE)
and triphenylamine. Some other photoresponsive systems
show the AIE e ﬀect through nonconventional mechanisms
such as through-space interactions. Although the synthetic
process is sometimes tedious, the polymers obtained by
chemical methods generally show better light sensitivity than
physical strategies due to the even distribution of AIEgens and
PRUs.
Through copolymerizations of difunctional AIE monomers
and photoresponsive monomers, photoresponsive AIE poly-
mers with functional groups along the polymer backbones
could be synthesized. For example, Lin and co-workers
synthesized a photoswitchable polymer via Cu(I)-catalyzed
azide−alkyne click polymerization of diarylethene(DAE)-
containing diynes and TPE-containing diazide ( Figure 1 A).
51
In 2019, Tang and co-workers developed an e ﬃ cient C −H-
activated polyspiroannulation to transform the 2-naphthols and
diynes into photoresponsive spiro-polymers. 52 In 2021, Tang
and co-workers synthesized photoresponsive polysulfonates via
catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization of easy-accessible
disulfonic acids and dihaloalkynes at room temperature with
100% atom economy in high yields. 49 On the other hand, side-
chain photoresponsive AIE polymers could be generated when
monofunctional photoresponsive monomers and AIE mono-
mers are used. Compared with the main-chain ones, the
solubility of the side-chain polymers is tunable by deploying an
amphiphilic polymer backbone. Thus, the side-chain photo-
responsive polymers are more easily adapted to multistimuli-
responsive materials. For example, in 2015, Akagi and co-
workers designed and synthesized several types of aromatic π-
conjugated polymers with photoswitchable emission by
combining phenylene- and thienylene-based main chains with
photochromic DAE side chains.
53 In 2020, Chen and co-
workers developed a set of photoresponsive liquid crystalline
polynorbornenes using an α-cyanostilbenic moiety as a side
chain.54 Lin and co-workers synthesized a side-chain polymer
with a stimuli response to light, pH, temperature, and CN − via
free radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide and TPE-
spiropyran-containing monomers ( Figure 1 B).55

Another way to generate photoresponsive AIE polymers is
by postmodi ﬁcation of AIE polymers with PRUs. Post-
modiﬁcations would be considered rudimentary and unviable
in the past as they require special postmodi ﬁed reactions with
extraordinary high e ﬃ ciency, and the patches generated along
the polymer chain are hard to remove and purify. 56 With the
development of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization
and click chemistry in recent decades, the e ﬃ ciency has been
greatly improved and postmodi ﬁcation polymerization could
been considered equally with direct polymerization.
57 Post-
modiﬁcations are feasible approaches to generate photo-
responsive AIE polymers via inducing a functional unit into
the polymer precursor. In 2019, He and co-workers
synthesized azo-caged AIE polymers by introducing 2-phenyl-
azo-4,5-dicyanoimidazole groups into a TPE-based epoxy
precursor polymer ( Figure 1 C).
58 The postmodi ﬁcation on
biobased polymers has a signi ﬁcant scope for the further
development of photoresponsive polymers used in biosys-
tems.
59,60 In 2020, Gu and co-workers constructed a type of
polymeric ﬂuorescent particles (PFPs), which could be linked
with nature killer (NK) cells by a ring opening reaction with a
high eﬃ ciency of about 92.7%.
61 In 2020, Tang and co-workers
developed a novel photobiosynthesis system by linking AIEgen
to chloroplast (cp) via metal-free click bioconjugation. 62
Although some postmodi ﬁcation reactions have been proven
to be e ﬃ cient, the postmodi ﬁcation conditions for di ﬀerent
polymers and monomers still are required to be optimized to
achieve the desired reaction e ﬃ ciency.
Besides the above-mentioned chemical synthetic strategies,
the in situ generation of photoresponsive AIE polymers via AIE
and photoresponsive inactive monomers is novel and
attractive. In 2019, Lin and co-workers synthesized a novel
photoresponsive AIE amphiphilic copolymer P(EG4- a-NA-
zoOMe) with azobenzene pendants via an azide −alkyne click
reaction from non-AIE-active monomers. 64 Observably re-
stricted, the intramolecular vibrational or torsional motions of
azobenzene groups upon aggregation lead to a strong AIE
eﬀect. In 2020, Yu and co-workers successfully synthesized a
photoresponsive, water-solubl e, AIE-active, double-helical
polymer via Passerini multicomponent polymerization-induced
assembly (Figure 1D).63 This special photoresponsive polymer
exhibits the AIE propriety via through-space interactions of
pyridines. When the polymer was irradiated by visible light
(452 nm), it degraded into small segments due to the cleavage
of the contained photolabile α-acyloxyamide structure via a
typical photoinduced electron-transfer process. This special
synthetic method provides a novel approach for preparing
advanced chiral materials with AIE and multiresponsive
characters. Such in situ generation strategies do not require
photosensitive or AIE-active monomers but are very
challenging because they require delicately designed mono-
mers and new polymerization methodologies.
2.2. Supramolecular Strategies. Supramolecular strat-
egies are another important method for the construction of
photoresponsive AIE polymers. Unlike the covalent methods,
supramolecular strategies utilize noncovalent interactions to
incorporate AIEgens and P RUs together under mild
conditions. These interactions include host −guest interac-
tions,
47 hydrogen bonding, 65 metal−ligand coordinate inter-
actions,66 van der Waals interactions, 67 and other weak
interactions.68,69 Due to the reversibility of these noncovalent
interactions, the generated polymers exhibit dynamic proper-

ties such as reversible gel −sol and liquid crystal −isotropic
transition, and thus, they are ideal candidates for practical
applications including drug delivery, phototherapy, photog-
raphy, paints/coatings, optical memories, and biosensors.
Among these noncovalent interactions, host −guest inter-
actions are one of the most widely studied systems in
photoresponsive polymers. Supramolecular photoresponsive
AIE polymers based on host −guest interactions show not only
various well-de ﬁned macromolecular architectures but also
high reversibility by light irradiation. In 2016, Liu and co-
workers reported a cross-linked supramolecular polymer
constructed by a host −guest interaction of cucurbit[8]uril
(CB[8]), azobenzene derivative, and TPE moiety containing
1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium dication (DMV 2+)( Figure
2A).70 The E-azobenzene was able to serve as a second
guest for a CB[8]/(DMV 2+) binary complex to form a new
ternary complex, while the bent-shaped Z-azobenzene was not
favorable for binding with CB[8]. This supramolecular
polymer was disassociated upon light irradiation due to the
photoisomerization of azobenzene. In 2016, Zhu et al.
synthesized a light/pH-dual-responsive AIE supramolecular
nanoparticle for gene delivery via host −guest recognition
between an N,N-dimethylethylenediamine-functionalized β-
cyclodextrin host and adamantane-modi ﬁed dimethylamino-
azobenzene guest. 71 In 2021, Liu and co-workers reported a
photocontrolled light-harvesting supramolecular assembly with
aggregation-induced excimer emission fabricated by poly-
anionic γ-cyclodextrin, pyrene derivative, Nile red, and DAE
derivative.72 The ﬂuorescence of the supramolecular nano-
particles could be reversibly switched on/o ﬀ by irradiation
with UV or visible light due to the reversible ring opening −
closing photoreaction of DAE.
The hydrogen bonding interaction is also commonly used in
the construction of supramolecular polymers. Unlike the host −
guest interactions, the polymers prepared by such interactions
usually su ﬀer from weak mechanical properties. Therefore,
using covalent polymer as a backbone and hydrogen bond
forming functional moieties as side chains is commonly used in
synthesizing such polymers. In 2018, Chen et al. constructed a
supramolecular side-chain polymer based on hydrogen
bonding of poly(4-vinylpyridine) and a dendritic α-cyanos-
tilbene derivative ( Figure 2 B).73 The obtained polymer
exhibited multiple reversible photoresponse abilities, including
structures, surface topographies, ﬂuorescence intensity, and
color. In 2018, Park and co-workers synthesized photo-
responsive polymer gel by cross-linking difunctional α-
cyanostilbene derivatives with poly(acrylic acid) via multi-
hydrogen bonding interactions. 74 Upon UV irradiation, this
polymer could transform from gel to sol and change its
ﬂuorescence color and intensity from strong green to weak
blue. In 2019, Li et al. synthesized a visible light responsive
AIE organogel and xergel containing an anthracene-based
acylhydrazone derivative. Upon the visible light irradiation, the
organogel and xerogel exhibited gel −sol transition due to the
cis−trans isomerization of hte CN bond.
75 In 2020,
Jiang and co-workers designed and synthesized two benzene-
1,3,5-tricarboxamide-based cyanostilbene derivatives with
diﬀerent cyano positions, namely, α-BTTPA and β-BTTPA,
which could form well-organized one-dimensional photo-
responsive self-assemblies (ribbons and ﬁbers, respectively)
via the synergistic e ﬀect of the hydrogen bonding interaction
and π−π interaction. This work explained the relationship
between the molecular structure and the transition of emission
properties during the cis −trans photoisomerization process of
cyanostilbene.76
The coordination interaction has been an e ﬃ cient approach
in supramolecular strategies for its high strength and
directionality. Photoresponsive coordination polymers can be
prepared through the rational design of ligands and the
appropriate selection of metal. In 2019, Zhou and co-workers
developed a new doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded visible-light-
responsive Pt(IV) prodrug and TPE copolymer nanoparticles
used in combination therapy. Light could activate the Pt(IV)
prodrug into the active Pt(II) drug and release encapsulated
DOX at the same time. 77 In 2020, Liu and co-workers
developed a photoresponsive carrier-free hybrid nanosphere
platform integrated Fe 3+ AIE photosensor and a Bcl-2 inhibitor
(sabutoclax) via coordination-driven self-assembly. 78 Under

laser irradiation, Fe 3+ could increase the intracellular O 2
concentration via a Fenton reaction, which further improves
the ROS generation e ﬃ ciency and enhances the photodynamic
therapy.
2.3. Physical Strategies. Besides the aforementioned
strategies, photoresponsive AIE polymers can also be
constructed by the physical combination of photoresponsive
AIE small molecules with polymeric materials by either doping
or encapsulation. Currently, the most common preparation
methods include but are not limited to drop-casting,
79 spin-
coating,80 electrospinning,81 microencapsulation,82 and 3D and
4D printing. 83,84 Unlike the former strategies that require a
high preparation cost and sophisticated synthetic route, AIE
polymers prepared by physical strategies usually bene ﬁt from
facile fabrication procedures, economical friendliness, and wide
applications. Photoresponsive AIE small molecules ( Figure 3 )
commonly suﬀer from obstacles for practical applications such
as poor mechanical strength, but such problems could be easily
solved by combining these molecules with appropriate polymer
materials. The photoresponsive AIE polymers constructed by
physical methods are suitable for practical applications, such as
solar-driven desalination,
85 photothermal ﬁbers,86 and photo-
thermal therapy.87 Due to the recent booming in AIE research,
various AIEgens with photophysical responsive properties have
been synthesized. Deﬁnitely, the combination of these AIEgens
with optimal polymer matrixes can generate numerous valuable
advanced materials and facilitate the development of smart
materials.
3. PHOTOCHEMICAL RESPONSIVE SYSTEMS
Photochemical responsive systems are designed by photo-
chemical reactions that could induce macroscopic property
changes. When these materials are irradiated by light, they are
excited from the ground state to the excited state. The excited
states could induce chemical reactions in the materials
themselves or the surrounding environment to trigger a
photoresponse, such as photoisomerization, a ring opening −
closing photoreaction, photolysis, and photosensitization
(Table 1 ). The photoisomerizable azobenzenes and α-
cyanostilbenes are typical photoresponsive structures used in
photoisomeric polymers, which could undergo gel-iso trans-
formation and photochromic responsiveness induced by light.
Spiropyran (SP) and diarylethene (DAE) derivatives are
generally designed for photoresponsive chemosensors based
on their facile ring opening −closing photoreactions. Unlike the
above-mentioned examples, which produce structural changes
in RPU per se, photosensitization is a type of chemical reaction
occurring in the surrounding environment of the materials
under light irradiation. Azonia aromatic heterocycles are typical
structures of this photoreaction, and polymers containing these
moieties can be applied in the biological ﬁeld for their ability to
generate reactive oxygen species e ﬃ ciently. On the basis of the
RIM mechanism, the nonradiative decay of the aggregated
AIEgens is minimized, which saves energy for ﬂuorescence and
intersystem crossing.
88 The e ﬃ cient luminescence in the
aggregated state can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in practical
applications, while the longer triplet lifetime could increase the
eﬃ ciency for ROS generation in photodynamic therapy.
Through the rational design of various RPUs, the resulting
AIE polymers can be used in a variety of practical applications,

F
such as chemosensors, photopatterning, photodegradation, and
biological applications.
3.1. Chemosensors. Photoluminescence chemosensors
have attracted a lot of attention due to their considerable
advantages such as simplicity, convenience, and low cost of
implementation. Sensitivity is an essential property of sensors,
and SP has become a popular candidate in photoluminescence
chemical sensors for their special reverse photoreaction with a
high-contrast color chan ge. On the other hand, the
introduction of the AIE e ﬀect can signi ﬁcantly improve the
emission intensity of photoluminescence materials. Therefore,
chemosensors based on photoresponsive AIE polymers
generally show higher sensitivity and a lower limit of detection
(LOD).
Photoluminescence chemosensors working under the photo-
chemical responsive mechanism are commonly designed by
using a photoluminescence change caused by the result of the
photostable PRUs with a speci ﬁc chemical group. In 2020, Lin
and co-workers reported a novel amphiphilic photoresponsive
AIE polymer ( 2) by copolymerization of N-isopropylacryla-
mide (NIPAM) and the TPE −SP monomer.
55 Upon light
irradiation, the structure of the polymer changes from 2 to 11
and the emission color changes from green (517 nm) to red
(627 nm) due to the Fo ̈rster resonance energy transfer
(FRET). More interestingly, the CN − ion can react with the
carbon atom ( CN+) of merocyanine moieties to
signiﬁcantly interrupt the π-conjugation of 11 to restore the
ﬂuorescence color back to green by hindering the FRET
process ( Figure 4 A). This chemical sensor shows good
detectability toward CN − in water with a very high selectivity
and sensitivity (LOD = 0.26 μM, Figure 4B) and is promising
for further biologic detection.
3.2. Photopatterning. Photopatterning is a process in
which the pattern on the template is transferred to the
materials through a photochemical reaction. It plays an
irreplaceable role in optoelectronics and has attracted a lot
of attention for its signi ﬁcant accuracy compared to molding
and printing.
96−98 Photopatterning not only greatly improves
the precision of material surface modi ﬁcation but also extends
the application of polymer materials to highly precise ﬁeld-
eﬀect transistors, high-resolved ﬂexible display devices, and
highly sensitive wearable detection devices.
Photopatterning could be divided into rewritable and
nonrewritable on the basis of the type of photochemical
reactions. Rewritable photopatterning generally operates under
reversible photochemical reactions such as photoisomerization
and the ring opening −closing reaction. In 2017, Zhang and co-
workers designed novel photoswitchable ﬂuorescent polymer
nanoparticles (PFPNs) via encapsulation of a hydrophobic
AIEgen called 4-phenylenebis( 4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)
methanone ( 13) by an amphiphilic photochromic copolymer
(14).
93 The UV light could switch the polymer structure from

14 to 15 and the ﬂuorescence color from green to pink owing
to the FRET process of 13 and MC groups of 15 (Figure 5A).
The prepared PFPNs exhibit a high dual-color ﬂuorescence
contrast, fast photoresponsiveness, and long-term stability,
which it a good candidate for rewritable photopatterning. The
ﬂuorescence pattern of the letter “AIE” was recorded upon UV
(365 nm) excitation by covering with pattern A. Then, the
letters could be erased with the UV light after the removal of
pattern A. Similarly, visible light could also induce the
recording/erasing process. Thus, a rewritable photopattern
was achieved by alternate irradiation of a photomask by UV −
visible light ( Figure 5 B).
Nonrewritable photopatterning can be utilized not only in
traditional photopattern applications such as information
storage
52,99−101 but also in biosystems such as novel intravital
3D bioprinting, 102 which attracts signi ﬁcant attention from
various disciplines. In 2021, Tang and co-workers developed a
catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization for the in situ
generation of photoresponsive polysulfonates 16 at room
temperature in air with 100% atom economy in high yields
using easily accessible disulfonic acids and dihaloalkynes.
49
Compared with traditional synthetic strategies, this new
strategy did not require photosensitive monomers or strict
synthetic conditions. The photoreponsive ﬂuorescence of the
resulting polysulfonates was profoundly studied and explored
for multiple applications ( Figure 6 A−C). The detailed
mechanism study shows that strong photoacid generation
and photodegradation occur in the polymers upon UV
irradiation ( Figure 6 D). Such unique photoresponsive
behaviors have been well utilized in highly ordered dual-
emissive ( Figure 6 E,F) and 3D ﬂuorescent photopatterning as
well as the phototunable refractive index using a single material
in a short time. Furthermore, as strong photoacid generators,
the polysulfonates could not only realize the UV-triggered
irreversible broad-spectrum in vitro sterilization but also show
hypotoxicity in high dosage or under visible light. Besides, the
halogen-containing polysulfonates could undergo e ﬃ cient
postfunctionalization to fur ther expand the variety and
functionality of photoresponsive polyesters.
3.3. Photodynamic Therapy. Photodynamic therapy has
attracted great interest in multidisciplinary research areas
owing to its signi ﬁcant status in modern precision medicine for
its well-established, photocontrolled precision treatment.
Generally speaking, the light-excited photoresponsive materials
undergo an intersystem crossing (ISC) process, which transfers
its energy to a highly sensitive T
1 state from the S 1 state. Then,
the excited energy can be further transferred to the
surrounding molecules such as oxygen to generate reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which are able to cause cell damage and
apoptosis.
103−105
In 2019, Tang and co-workers developed an e ﬃ cient one-
pot, charge-generating polymerization route to in situ generate
functional azonia-containing polyelectrolytes 17−19 from
readily accessible nonionic reactant and commercially available
cheap ionic species ( Figure 7 A).95 The resulting polyelec-
trolytes possessed not only a rigid backbone with a strong
donor−acceptor conjugated structure but also a reasonable
conjugation length to trigger the ISC process. These features
endow the polyelectrolytes with extraordinarily strong ROS
generation ability ( Figure 7 B) and could impressively kill the
drug resistant superbug. 17 was also demonstrated to
eﬀectively kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) both in vitro and in the MRSA-infected mouse
burn model ( Figure 7 C,D). The one-pot synthetic method-
ology for azonia-containing polyelectrolyte provides a new
strategy for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes, enriches the
family of functional polyelectrolytes, and o ﬀers enormous
opportunities for further research on polyelectrolytes.
3.4. Controlled Drug Delivery. The light-controlled drug
delivery is appealing for the precise release of drug at the
pathological site to overcome the multidrug resistance and
improve chemotherapy e ﬃ ciency. In 2016, Liu and co-workers
designed a novel nanoparticle (NP) for controlled drug
delivery by self-assembly of doxorubicin (DOX) and a
photoresponsive AIE polymer ( 20)( Figure 8 A,B).
106 The
amphiphilic polymer 20 were constructed by the conjugation
of polyethylene glycol with an AIEgen through a ROS
cleavable thioketal (TK) linker. The free DOX can be easily
eﬄ uxed by the P-glycoprotein pump in drug-resistant cancer
cells, but the controlled drug delivery system ( 20-NPs/DOX)
could overcome the drug resistance and was endocytosed by
the cancer cells and entrapped in endo/lysosomes. Upon white
light irradiation, the generated ROS not only enhanced the
membrane permeability of endolysosomes to facilitate the
escape of NP to the cytosol but also broke the TK linker to
lead to the disassembly of the NP. Consequently, DOX was
released to the cytosol for nuclear entry to increase the drug
retention in cancer cells ( Figure 8 C). On the basis of the
working mechanism, this photocontrolled drug delivery system

can eﬃ ciently overcome the drug resistance in cancer cells and
enables precise drug release in the pathological site.
3.5. Antitumor Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a
type of cancer treatment that boosts the natural defenses by
helping the immune system to recognize, interfere, and destroy
cancer cells and prevent metastasis. Compared with other
treatments, immunotherapy could provide long-term immune
memory to protect the treated mice from tumor cell
rechallenge. Photoresponsive AIE polymers enable immuno-
therapy to operate in a precise and visionary way to monitor
the treatment process. In 2020, Gu and co-workers constructed
a type of polymeric ﬂuorescent particles (PFPs) for light
controlled antitumor immunotherapy.
61 These PFPs were
synthesized via precipitation polymerization by mixing TPE-
VBC (21), maleic anhydride (MAH), and styrene (St) ( Figure
9A). The precipitation polymerization could be divided into
three stages. In stage I, the ﬂuorescence enhanced slowly with
an increase in the particle size due to the loose packing of the
polymer chain at the beginning of the polymerization process,
which could not strongly restrict the intramolecular motions of
21. In stage II, the ﬂuorescence intensity increased sharply as
more 21 was copolymerized and deposited on the surface of
the nuclei. In stage III, the ﬂuorescence intensity increased
slowly again, and even the particles grew bigger due to the
limited amount of 21 in solution. The PFPs could be linked
with nature killer (NK) cells by a ring opening reaction with a
high labeling e ﬃ ciency of about 92.7% within 1 h ( Figure
9B,C). Compared to NK cells, the PFP-coated NK cells
exhibited the same capacity of inducing the release of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) from MCF-7 cancerous cells in the
absence of light irradiation, which demonstrated the good
biocompatibility of PFPs. Upon light irradiation, the PFP-
coated NK cells evoked more LDH release from the MCF-7
cancerous cells than the control group due to the ROS
generated from 21 under light irradiation activated NK cells
and promoted immunotherapy e ﬃ ciency to cancer cells
(Figure 9 D).
4. PHOTOPHYSICAL RESPONSIVE SYSTEMS
Photophysical responsive systems are designed by utilizing
physical changes caused by di ﬀerent decay pathways after light
excitation. Unlike the photochemical responsive systems,
which are deactivated through photochemical reactions by
partial photoenergy transfer to chemical energy, the photo-
physical responsive materials are deactivated via two di ﬀerent
relaxation pathways, namely, radiative decay and nonradiative
relaxation. The radiative decay of materials contribute to the
ﬂuorescence (FL), phosphorescence (PL),
107 and photo-
dynamic therapy (PDT), while the nonradiative decay could
transfer the energy of light into heat by molecular vibration to
evoke photothermal therapy (PTT) and a photoacoustic (PA)
eﬀect. Although these two decay pathways simultaneously
existed and it was impossible to exclude any one completely,
the corresponding macro-physical properties could be obtained
through appropriate molecular design to favor a particular
pathway. On the basis of this, photophysical responsive
materials with either a FL/PDT or PA/PTT e ﬀect could be
constructed. The PTT and PA e ﬀects can be applied in
practical applications such as desalination and photothermal
ﬁber. On the other hand, ﬂuorescence can be changed to other
forms of energy such as photobiosynthesis. Owing to the
inherent rotor-rich structures of AIEgens, they have the
potential for e ﬃ cient photothermal and photoacoustic
conversion and further enhance the photothermal therapy
and photoacoustic imaging.
46 Meanwhile, the high quantum
yield makes the AIEgens a powerful tool in improving

photobiosynthesis e ﬃ ciency by bioconjugation with chlor-
oplasts.
4.1. Photothermal Therapy. The photothermal e ﬀect,
which converts the absorbed light into localized heat via
intramolecular movements and collisions with surrounding
molecules, is the most widely studied photophysical response.
Numerous practical applications such as solar-driven water
evaporation, photothermal ﬁber, and PTT have been achieved
on the basis of the photothermal e ﬀect.108
Solar-driven desalination is an e ﬀective method to address
the serious water shortage by directly utilizing the photo-
thermal e ﬀect. So far, various photothermal materials have
been developed to convert solar light into heat, such as metal-
based inorganic materials, carbon-based materials, and
conjugated polymers. Compared with traditional photothermal
materials, photothermal AIE materials are more ideal for
desalination because the molecular rotors and/or vibrators in
AIE moieties are favorable to boost the photothermal
conversion e ﬃ ciency.
109 In 2020, Gu and co-workers
synthesized a photothermal molecule ( 7) containing AIEgens
with broad absorption from 300 to 1600 nm upon aggregation.
A photophysical responsive polymer (PU- 7) was further
constructed by doping molecule 7 into polyurethane (PU). 85
Compared to the pure colorless PU, the brownish-black PU- 7
owned a much rougher surface, which indicated 7 was doped
in PU as small aggregates ( Figure 10 A). Such aggregates
enhanced the sunlight harvesting ability of PU- 7 because its
absorption was more ﬁt to the solar spectral irradiance ( Figure
10B). The enhanced sunlight harvesting enabled the doped
materials to show better solar −heat conversion and heat up to
77 °C, which was much higher than PU (30 °C) under the
same condition (Figure 10C). On the basis of the better solar −
heat conversion of PU- 7, a solar-driven water evaporation
system (Figure 10D) was built for further particle applications.
Putting the heating process of water under sunlight irradiation,
the surface temperature of PU- 7 foam ﬂoating on the water
was 10 °C higher than pure PU ( Figure 10E). The eﬃ ciency of
solar-driven water evaporation of PU-7 was calculated to be
87.2%, which evidently demonstrated that molecule 7 could
greatly accelerate the solar −heat conversion.
The induction of functional molecules with a photothermal
eﬀect into hybrid nano ﬁbers can lead to various applications
such as solar steam generation, smart clothing, and thermal
management. In 2020, Wang and co-workers constructed a
core−shell ﬁber with a high e ﬃ ciency of solar−heat conversion
by coaxial electrospinning of molecule 9 and poly(vinylidene

and after irradiation. (C) Quantitative antibacterial tests of 17 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the presence or

ﬂuoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene) ( Figure 11 A).86 The photo-
thermal nano ﬁber could be heated to 56.1 °C with 1 sun
irradiation ( Figure 11 B). Meanwhile, the ﬁber showed an
obvious temperature change even after 9 rounds of irradiation,
which indicated the high stability of solar heat conversion
(Figure 11 C). The high e ﬃ ciency and stability of the heat
generation made the materials good candidates for photo-
thermal patches and clothing. A core −shell ﬁbrous patch was
further constructed from photothermal ﬁbers. After irradiation
of natural sunlight for 1 min, the temperature of the patch was
heated to 51.2 °C( Figure 11 D,E). This photothermal patch
could also be heated to 24 °C under natural light irradiation in
a0 °Ce n v i r o n m e n t(Figure 11 F), indicating that this
photothermal ﬁber could be used for outdoor clothing with
the ability of keeping humans warm in a cold environment.
Besides the aforementioned applications, PTT is another
application of the photothermal e ﬀect. PTT is a novel precise
tumor treatment in modern medicine, which utilizes the local
high temperature elevated by continuous-wave lasers to kill
tumor cells. In 2019, Lu et al. constructed novel nanoparticles
(NPs) by combining molecule 9 with human serum albumin
(HSA) through van der Waals and hydrogen bonding
interactions ( Figure 12 A).
87 This material showed a better
PTT eﬀect toward mice bearing a CT26-Luc orthotopic tumor
compared to conventional PTT medicine. Unlike phosphate
buﬀer saline (PBS) and conventional PPT, the NPs not only
oﬀered a complete cure of cancer with the optimized laser
doses but also ensured no recurrence in 30 days ( Figure
12B,C).
4.2. Photoacoustic Imaging. The photoacoustic (PA)
eﬀect is a follow-up phenomenon of the photothermal e ﬀect.
When the excited materials undergo nonradiative decay, the
molecular motion induces localized heat, which could further
induce transient thermoelastic expansion and wideband
acoustic waves/phonons. When the phonons are detected,
PA imaging can provide 3D images of deeper tissues with
enhanced signal contrast and high spatial resolution, which
makes the PA imaging receive considerable attention in
modern medicine and interdisciplinary studies. Among various
PA imaging agents, nanoparticles containing organic π-
conjugated molecules or polymers are more suitable for
utilization in biosystems than their inorganic counterparts due
to their good biocompatibility. In 2019, Tang and co-workers
developed a highly e ﬃ cient water-soluble photothermal
nanoagent by doping the photothermal molecule ( 10) with a
D−A structure into 1,2-distearoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphoetha-
nolamine-N-[methoxy-(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-
PEG
2000)( Figure 13A).110 This nanoagent owned an excellent
photothermal conversion e ﬃ ciency of 54.9%, which was much
higher than currently available photothermal agents. This is
due to the active excited-state intramolecular motion in
aggregate, which induced the strong photothermal e ﬀect.

The further live animal PA imaging experiment was conducted
in the subcutaneous xenograft 4T1 breast tumor-bearing
mouse model. The PA intensity at 4 h was around 2.7-fold
higher than that at 0 h ( Figure 13B), which bene ﬁted from the
excellent e ﬀect of the enhanced permeability retention and
prominent PA e ﬀect.
4.3. Photobiosynthesis. Photobiosynthesis, in which
carbon dioxide and water are converted into usable chemical
energy under light irradiation in organisms, 62 is one of the
most important photoreactions in the world for sustaining
planet life. Photosynthesis mainly occurs in chloroplasts and
cyanobacteria that are rich in chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B.
However, such a signi ﬁcant process su ﬀers from incomplete
usage of solar energy due to the partial match between the
solar radiation spectrum and the absorption pro ﬁle of
chloroplasts. Chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B can e ﬃ ciently
absorb blue and red light but hardly capture light at less than
350 nm. Therefore, the conversion of light with wavelengths of
less than 350 nm into blue or red light can e ﬀectively increase
the utilization of light by chloroplasts to enhance photosyn-
thesis. AIEgens have become good candidates for the
enhancement of photobiosynthesis due to their e ﬃ cient light
emission in the solid state.
In 2020, Tang and co-workers developed a novel photo-
biosynthesis system by linking AIEgen ( 22) to chloroplast (cp)
via metal-free click bioconjugation ( Figure 14 A).
62 2,6-
Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) was chosen to verify
the photosynthetic enhancement of 22-cp. As an arti ﬁcial
electron acceptor, DCPIP could trap the electrons generated
from the process of water splitting and electron separation in
photosystem II ( Figure 14 B). Therefore, the reduction of
DCPIP could evaluate the photosynthetic activity of 22-cp.
Under the irradiation of 1 mW/cm
2 visual light, 22-cp led to a
more rapid decrease of the absorption of DCPIP than that of
cp, and the gap between them could be further widened when
the visual light intensity was increased from 1 to 2 mW/cm
2
(Figure 14 C). It was because 22-cp generated more electrons
from water separation and distinctly accelerated the reduction
of DCPIP under irradiation. Meanwhile, the stronger light
irradiation could further promote the photosynthetic reaction

rate. These results testi ﬁed that AIEgen 22 improved
photobiosynthesis by applying more usable energy for cp.
On the other hand, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is another
important product in the photosynthetic system, and its
amount change was further measured by the luciferin/
luciferase assay. The results demonstrated that 22-cp could
generate more ATP under visual irradiation ( Figure 14 D).
These results showed that 22 could improve the light
absorption capability, energy trapping, and energy e ﬃ ciency
for the electron transfer of the per reaction center of cp. The
bioconjugation strategy based on 22 can noticeably augment
the photosynthesis of chloroplasts. The enhanced photo-
biosynthesis can be obtained in a cyanobacteria (cb) system by
using AIEgens called 3-diphenylamino-6-(2pyridinyl) phenyl-

challenges.
5. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
The introduction of AIEgens into photoresponsive materials
has been found to greatly improve their photoresponsive
performance and expand the scope of applications. The role of
AIEgens in photoresponsive AIE polymers can be summarized
as follows: (1) e ﬀectively solve the ACQ problem; (2) provide
higher ﬂuorescence intensity to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio
in practical applications; (3) introduce unique photophysical
properties; (4) improve the e ﬃ ciency of phototherapies
(PDT/PTT). In this Review, we systematically summarized
photoresponsive AIE polymers with an emphasis on their
general construction strategies, responsive mechanisms, and

applications. These polymers are generally constructed by
linking AIEgens with photoresponsive units via chemical,
supramolecular, and physical strategies. According to the
working mechanisms, two main responsive systems, namely,
photochemical and photophysical, are classi ﬁed. The photo-
responsive AIE polymers showed excellent performance in
various applications such as chemosensors, photopatterning,
photodegradation, photodynamic therapy, photothermal ther-
apy, photoacoustic imaging, and photobiosynthesis. All the
achievements and advantages indicated the fascinating proper-
ties and bright future of photoresponsive AIE polymers.

O
Various photoresponsive AIE polymers with fascinating
properties have been made to convert light into other energy
forms. However, the research on these materials is still in the
infant stage. We are convinced that further e ﬀorts in the
following aspects will ﬂourish the photoresponsive AIE
polymers ( Scheme 2 ). First, despite numerous photorespon-
sive AIE polymers having been constructed via the above-
mentioned strategies, the mainstreams of AIEgens used to
construct polymers are TPE and TPA. Therefore, the
incorporation of new AIEgens into photoresponsive AIE
polymers can enrich structural diversity, properties, and
applications of the resulting polymers. Besides pursuing new
AIEgens, the exploration of e ﬃ cient construction strategies will
also promote the development of photoresponsive AIE
polymers. Speci ﬁcally, multicomponent polymerization has
become one of the hottest research areas in recent years, as the
incorporation of more components will enrich the structural
and functional diversity. The development of new photo-
responsive AIE polymers via supramolecular strategies is
interesting for the special changes of physical topography
and physical properties of these macromolecules. This
additional response brings photoresponsive AIE polymers
into practical self-circulating applications such as logic gate
devices, microscopic mass transfer, and light-controlled
nanochannels. Because of the boom of new material emerging
platforms, more construction methods have been invented to
construct these photoresponsive AIE polymers, such as the
melt-processing method and 3D printing technology, which
will greatly improve the physical strategies and convert
photoresponsive AIEgens into polymer forms for further
applications.
Second, the types of photochemical responsive systems are
still very limited. Although more than 20 types of photo-
chemical responsive units have been reported, less than half of
them have been successfully used in the construction of
photoresponsive AIE polymers. Therefore, the exploration of
new photoresponsive units that operate in varied mechanisms,
such as catalyst-free light-controlled cycloaddition, will greatly
enrich the types and further improve the development of
photochemical responsive systems. On the other hand, the
improvement of the performance (such as low energy light
excitation) of the existing systems is also an important aspect
to promote the development of this ﬁeld. Also, research on
new light-stimulated chemical response mechanisms is crucial
for the future of this ﬁeld, such as the in situ generation of the
photolabile structure, which endows the polymers with
photodegradation properties.
Third, for photophysical responsive systems, many applica-
tions have been reported such as photothermal therapy,
photoacoustic imaging, and photobiosynthesis. Almost all the
photophysical responsive systems are designed with the
nonradiative decay process of the excited state. Generally,
ﬂuorescence is not regarded as a light response behavior
because it does not trigger photoinduced chemical/structural
changes. However, if the ﬂuorescence is further transferred to
other energy forms such as electricity and bioenergy, the
applications of the photoresponsive AIE polymers could be
further expanded to more exciting areas. From this perspective,
further research on the secondary utilization of ﬂuorescence
will greatly enrich the photophysical responsive applications
such as phototransistors, photodetectors, and optical memo-
ries. At present, the applic ations of the photophysical
responsive systems in the photothermal area are mature with
numerous cases, which makes the study on the structure −
activity relationship of these systems a potential future research
direction for the long-term development of this ﬁeld. Machine
learning and arti ﬁcial intelligence predictions of new structures
will lead traditional materials research into a new era.
Finally, the AIEgen platform has been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration,
112 indicating that AIEgens are good
candidates for further particle applications in modern
medicine. Thus, research on the biological safety of these
materials is required to ﬂourish them in the biological ﬁeld.
Systematic research on the biological safety and renal
metabolic toxicity of these molecules is essential for the future
development and possible industrialization of biological
applications. Meanwhile, the use of ﬂuorescence generated
by a photophysical response to improve the light utilization
eﬃ ciency of traditional light-conversion organisms and/or
tissues also shows excellent application prospects. Studies have
shown that linking AIEgens with chloroplasts can increase the
utilization of solar light by chloroplasts and produce more ATP
under the same conditions. New types of photophysical
responsive materials that promote photosynthesis may be
another possible solution to the world food crisis.
We believe that AIEgens will play vital roles in the
exploration of novel photoresponsive polymers through
integration with various construction strategies and cutting-
edge techniques. We hope this Review will inspire more
scientiﬁc researchers to engage in this area, which has a bright
future, and altogether promote an understanding of the full
potential and further development of photoresponsive AIE
polymers for widespread applications.
