CONSPECTUS: Charged organic molecules, such as DNA, RNA,
proteins, and polysaccharides, are ubiquitous and indispensable in
natural living systems, which possess speci ﬁc biological functions to
interact with oppositely charged species via electrostatic attraction.
The molecules with inherent charges typically di ﬀerentiate
themselves from the neutral ones with unique attributes (e.g.,
ionic interactions and high polarity), thereby playing a pivotal role
in a broad spectrum of areas, including supramolecular chemistry,
structural biology, and materials science. It is thus of great
importance to explore and develop various charged organic systems
for biomimicry and the creation of functional materials. In 2001, our
group reported a peculiar luminogen that exhibited weak emission
in solution but had signi ﬁcantly enhanced emission in aggregates,
and we, for the ﬁrst time, coined this phenomenon as aggregation-induced emission (AIE). The AIE concept signi ﬁcantly changes
the cognition of the scienti ﬁc community toward classic photophysical phenomena. Since the discovery of this unusual luminescence
phenomenon, AIE luminogens (AIEgens) have attracted extensive attention from researchers in a plethora of disciplines because of
their high brightness in aggregates, large Stokes shift, excellent photostability, and good biocompatibility. In the past 10 years, our
laboratory has expended a great amount of e ﬀort to bring inherent charges into AIE research and acquired fruitful achievements.
In this Account, we summarize the progress of charged AIE systems primarily made by our laboratory. We start with a brief
introduction to charged AIEgens and then discuss their design strategies from molecular and topological perspectives, respectively.
Next, we review the unique properties of charged AIEgens, including D −A interactions, anion −π
+ interactions, and intermolecular
electrostatic interactions, with an emphasis on how they di ﬀerentiate themselves from the neutral analogs. On the one hand,
positively charged AIEgens exhibit unique photophysical properties by forming typical donor −acceptor structures to manipulate the
emission wavelength or initiate ultralong persistent luminescence. On the other hand, positively charged AIEgens exhibit unique
physiochemical properties, such as an adjustable targeting capability toward biological targets and a strong capability for the
generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, we showcase the applications of charged AIEgens in imaging and diagnosis,
photodynamic therapy, gas separation, and solar desalination. Finally, we conclude this Account with a summary and some
perspectives regarding the existing challenges and future directions. We hope that this Account can spark new ideas and inspire
scientists from di ﬀerent disciplines to explore this nascent yet promising research area.

1. INTRODUCTION
Charged organic species are widespread in natural living
systems, which play a crucial role in a variety of biological
processes, such as DNA transcription, protein folding, and
cellular signal transduction.
5,6 The root cause of why nature
adopts charged molecules probably lies in their unique
physiochemical properties, including dynamic ionic interac-
tions, excellent water solubility, high mobility, high conductivity,
and structural and functional ﬂexibility.
7 To unravel the mystery
of sophisticated biological machinery and develop new func-
tional materials, scientists have devoted considerable e ﬀort to
the study of charged organic systems. For example, the onset of
DNA nanotechnology in the 1980s greatly pro ﬁted from the
precise self-assembly of charged biological materials, leading to
the establishment of a series of compelling areas (e.g., DNA
origami).
8 Inspired by natural polyelectrolytes (e.g., DNA, RNA,
proteins, and polysaccharides), synthetic polyelectrolytes have
been developed to understand their formation mechanisms and
biological functions. Besides, certain functional components
have also been introduced into synthetic polyelectrolytes to
enable extra functionalities beyond nature.
9 Over the past few
decades, scientists have set up a plethora of research frontiers
related to charged organic molecules and have actively explored
their practical applications, including energy,
10 environmental,11
and biomedical ﬁelds.12

In 2001, our group reported an unusual luminescence
phenomenon of a propeller-shaped organic molecule 1-
methyl-1,2,3,4,5-pentaphenylsilole, which was weakly emissive
in solution but showed remarkably enhanced emission in
aggregates.
13 This unique phenomenon was de ﬁned as
aggregation-induced emission (AIE), which signi ﬁcantly breaks
the constraints of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and
thereby changes the cognition of the scienti ﬁc community
toward classic photophysical phenomena. In contrast to
conventional ACQ luminogens, AIE luminogens (AIEgens)
exhibit a multitude of bene ﬁts, such as high brightness in
aggregates, low background ﬂuorescence, excellent photo-
stability, and good biocompatibility, making them an attractive
class of luminescent materials.
14,15 Nevertheless, these prom-
inent advantages are somewhat underutilized in the early stage.
Speciﬁcally, early studies primarily focused on the development
of neutral AIEgens with shor t-wavelength emission as
exempliﬁed by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), hexaphenylsilole
(HPS), and their derivatives. 16 In terms of practical utilization,
these materials were de ﬁcient in functionality and speci ﬁcity.
Later on, the introduction of inherent charges into AIEgens
largely broadened the scope of AIE research. At the beginning,
charged AIEgens were designed to identify given analytes with
opposite charges through electrostatic interactions.
17 Afterward,
the assembly behaviors of charged AIEgens were desirably
employed to construct various functional systems, including
light-harvesting materials,
18 circularly polarized luminescent
materials,19 supramolecular organic room-temperature phos-
phorescence (RTP) materials,20 highly emissive metallacages,21
and pure organic cages. 22 Furthermore, the photophysical
behaviors and photochemical processes of charged AIEgens
were desirably tuned simply by varying the counterions.
3,23
The combination of inherent charges and AIE opens up a
brand new and hot frontier in chemical research and has yielded
fruitful achievements in the past decade. However, there is a lack
of prior publications that systematically elaborate on the
research progress of charged AIE systems. In this Account, we
aim to provide an in-depth overview of the fundamentals of
inherently charged AIE systems and answer some critical
scientiﬁc questions. For example, how can one achieve the
rational design of charged AIE systems with the desired
properties? How do charged AIEgens di ﬀerentiate themselves
from the neutral ones? Why are they ideal candidates for speciﬁc
applications? Speciﬁcally, we start with a discussion of the design
strategies of charged AIEgens from molecular and topological
perspectives, respectively. Next, we review the unique properties
of charged AIEgens, including D −A interactions, anion −π
+
interactions, and intermolecular electrostatic interactions, with
an emphasis on how they di ﬀerentiate themselves from the
neutral analogs. Furthermore, we showcase the applications of
charged AIEgens in imaging and diagnosis, photodynamic
therapy, gas separation, and solar desalination. Finally, we
conclude this Account with a summary and some perspectives
regarding the existing challenges and future directions.
2. DESIGN STRATEGIES OF CHARGED AIEGENS
2.1. From a Molecular Perspective
In terms of designing charged AIEgens, the AIE moieties and the
corresponding counterions are two indispensable components.
To endow charged molecules with AIE characteristics, one
popular strategy is to decorate the ionic core with adequate
aromatic rotors (Figure 1A, left), exempliﬁed by the phenyl ring,
pyridine, naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene.
1,3,24 In good
solvents, these rotors have active intramolecular rotations to
dramatically consume the excitation energy via nonradiative
transition. In contrast, the molecular motions are signi ﬁcantly
restricted in aggregates or in the solid state, leading to the
suppressed nonradiative decay and thus the activation of the
radiative channel. Another design strategy is to functionalize
previously reported neutral AIEgens with one or more charged
units ( Figure 1 A, right). Among various building blocks, TPE
and triphenylamine (TPA) are two classes of representative AIE
moieties for the construction of charged AIEgens ( Figure 1B).
TPE and its derivatives are the most reliable moieties to initiate
the AIE eﬀect (even after attachment with a variety of functional
groups), which can be seen in a large portion of charged
AIEgens.
25−27 Notably, although TPE is a weak electron donor,
its electron-donating ability can be reinforced by substituting the
phenyl rings with electron donors such as alkoxy groups.26 Being
another class of AIE moieties, TPA and its derivatives are
intrinsically strong electron donors due to the presence of a lone
pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. When an appropriate
cation is attached to the TPA moiety, a typical donor −acceptor
(D−A) structure is formed, which is a common strategy for red-
shifting the absorption and emission spectra of luminescent
materials.
28−31
On the basis of these two design strategies, our group has
developed a plethora of charged AIEgens with diverse
functionalities. To date, a library of organic cations has been
delicately established ( Figure 1 C). Speci ﬁcally, nonaromatic
quaternary ammonium 1 and quaternary phosphonium 2 can
endow charged AIEgens with improved water solubility.
31−33
Relative to nonaromatic cations, aromatic cations (either single
or multiple rings, 3−14) can bring about additional optical and
electronic properties for charged AIEgens due to the
introduction of delocalized π electrons. Among various aromatic
cations, pyridinium 5 is most commonly used because it can be
easily generated through an S N2 reaction between the pyridine
group and organic halides. 34 Besides, with the rapid develop-
ment of ring-closing metathesis and C−H activation/annulation
reactions,35 an increasing number of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon cations with high complexity and heteroatoms
have been exploited.
4,36−38 It is noteworthy that as the extension
of the aromatic structure, the hydrophobicity of the resulting
molecules is gradually increased, leading to decreased water
solubility. In terms of the anions, both inorganic (e.g., halide
ions, BF
4
−, and PF 6
−) and organic (e.g., CF 3SO3
− and BPh4
−)
groups have been demonstrated ( Figure 1D). In principle, they
can be directly incorporated through chemical reactions 38 or
introduced postreaction through ion exchange. 39 In most cases,
anions simply act as the counterion of the cationic AIE
moiety.40−42 However, some organic anions are covalently
attached to the AIE moiety to yield negatively charged
AIEgens.
43 Notably, the presence of counterions has a
p r o m i n e n ti m p a c to nt h es o l u b i l i t y ,40 toxicity, 44 crystal
packing,23 and photophysical properties, 3 providing a facile
approach for modulating the performance of the resulting
charged AIEgens.
2.2. From a Topological Perspective
Chemistry topology is becoming particularly important due to
its signiﬁcant impact on material performance. In this regard, our
group has expended great e ﬀort to build a series of charged
AIEgens featured as distinct molecular architectures. On the one
hand, the charged moieties can be utilized as repeating units

199
either in the backbone 36 or in the side chain 45 to form linear or
hyperbranched polymers (i.e., polyelectrolytes, Figure 2 A). In
contrast to small-molecule analogs, linear polyelectrolytes
typically exhibit red-shifted absorption and emission as well as
enhanced photosensitization due to the strengthened con-
jugation e ﬀect.45 Besides, the entanglement of polymer chains
within these linear polyelectrolytes gives rise to improved
mechanical strength and processability, facilitating their real-
world applications in the form of large-area thin ﬁlms through
simple spin coating. Notably, combined with AIE behavior, the
resulting polyelectrolyte thin ﬁlms are highly ﬂuorescent and are
ideal candidates for a variety of applications such as photo-
patterning.36 Unlike one-dimensional linear polyelectrolytes,
the polymer chains in the hyperbranched polyelectrolytes can
simultaneously elongate in three dimensions. Such a three-
dimensional (3D) structure is typically associated with
decreased chain entanglement and increased charge density in
the backbone.
4 In addition, the compact structure of hyper-
branched polyelectrolytes partially restricts intramolecular
motions, leading to the formation of single-molecule aggregates
even in dilute solution. 46 On the other hand, during the course
of noncovalent assembly, ionic interactions play a decisive role
in regulating the orientation and arrangement of small-molecule
charged AIEgens. Such a stable noncovalent linkage can be
employed to build supramolecular frameworks ( Figure 2 B).
47
Interestingly, through the rational design of the molecular
geometry and coordination modes of charged AIEgens, it is
possible to tune the pore size and tunnel shape of the resulting
supramolecular frameworks. Typically, supramolecular assem-
blies exhibit reversibly transformed properties due to their

AIE can serve as a useful tool to dynamically monitor the
assembly behavior, providing an opportunity for the develop-
ment of stimuli-responsive luminescent systems.

3. PROPERTIES OF CHARGED AIEGENS
As an attractive class of luminescent materials, charged AIEgens
simultaneously possess the unique properties of AIE and
(poly)electrolytes. Since the advantages of AIE have been
largely discussed elsewhere, we herein focus our discussion on
the extra properties introduced by the charged moieties,
including D −A interactions, anion −π
+ interactions, and
intermolecular electrostatic interactions.
3.1. D−A Interactions
In principle, the cationic moieties of charged AIEgens are
electron-deﬁcient, making them ideal electron acceptors to
facilitate intra- and intermolecular D−A interactions. In terms of
intramolecular D −A interactions, the hybridization of frontier
orbitals between the donor and the acceptor typically results in a
narrowed energy band gap; thus, the energy levels of charged
AIEgens can be rationally tuned through the selection of suitable
donor and acceptor units.
26,30,38 In polar environments, the
excited charged AIEgens undergo fast intramolecular electron
transfer from the donor to the acceptor, leading to the
conformational transition from a locally excited (LE) state to
a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state and thus
red-shifted emission ( Figure 3 A).
37,49 As a result, charged
AIEgens are ideal candidates for the construction of polarity-
sensitive ﬂuorescent probes. In an example, TVPA, a cationic
AIEgen with a typical D −A structure (chemical structure in
Figure 3B), showed a pronounced solvatochromic eﬀect, with its
emission color shifting from blue ( λ
em = 436 nm) to red ( λem =
610 nm) when the solvent varied from nonpolar toluene to
highly polar methanol ( Figure 3C).
29 Taking advantage of the
TICT eﬀect of TVPA, it was possible to visualize the microphase
separation and hydrophilicity-to-hydrophobicity transformation
of thermoresponsive composite hydrogels in response to
temperature variations.
Unlike intramolecular D −A interactions, the intermolecular
D−A interactions between positively charged AIEgens and
electron donors can facilitate intermolecular charge transfer,
charge separation, and charge migration, providing an
opportunity for the construction of organic long-persistent
luminescent systems. In a proposed model ( Figure 3 D), the
photoinduced charge transfer occurs between the donor and
acceptor to generate a pair of radicals, which is followed by
charge separation and multistep charge migration among the
acceptors. The excited radical eventually recombines with a
donor radical, leading to the release of energy in the form of
light. On the basis of this working mechanism, our group
developed a dual organic system with the electron-de ﬁcient
quaternary phosphonium bromide salt TPP-3C2B as the
acceptor and the electron-rich aromatic amine DMA as the
donor (chemical structures in Figure 3E).
2 In this system, TPP-
3C2B not only served as the electron acceptor to favor
photoinduced charge transfer but also stabilized the excited
radicals by suppressing unwanted reactions via the bulky phenyl
rings and favoring radical delocalization across the phenyl rings.
In this case, the electron was subjected to particularly slow
charge recombination, giving rise to visible afterglow lumines-
cence with a duration of up to 7 h, which is barely seen in
previous studies ( Figure 3F).
3.2. Anion−π+ Interactions
In terms of positively charged aromatic AIEgens, there exists a
strong a ﬃ nity between the aromatic cations and the counter-
anions due to electrostatic forces and ion-induced polarization,
referred to as anion −π
+ interactions.38,50 In a recent study, we
systematically investigated the role of anion −π+ interactions in
the manipulation of the photophysical properties of luminogens
(Figure 4A). In traditional neutral luminogens (e.g., TriPO-C,
Figure 4B), π−π stacking dominated intermolecular interactions
(Figure 4C), leading to the occurrence of ACQ due to molecular
aggregation.
1 Nevertheless, the detrimental π−π stacking could
be suppressed through the introduction of anion −π+ inter-
actions, which facilitated the ACQ-to-AIE transformation. For
example, a powder of TriPO-PN (a charged analog of TriPO-C)
exhibited a typical AIE phenomenon with a ﬂuorescence
quantum yield that was ca. 7-fold higher than that in solution.
Crystallographic analysis indicated that two PF
6
− anions were
located on both sides of the cationic oxazole core at distances of
3.385 and 3.416 Å, which could serve as built-in blockers to
impede π−π stacking ( Figure 4 D). Besides, by introducing
heavy halide ions (e.g., Br
− and I−) into the oxazolium system,
the resulting molecules exhibited both AIE and RTP character-
istics. In TPO-Br (another charged analog of TriPO-C), the
heavy atom Br
− was spatially close to the cationic chromophore

due to the anion−π+ interactions (Figure 4E).3 In this situation,
the intersystem crossing (ISC) channel was desirably switched
on, causing the powder of TPO-Br to exhibit detectable RTP
with a lifetime of up to 706 μs.
3.3. Intermolecular Electrostatic Interactions
Electrostatic interactions (i.e., opposite charges attract whereas
identical charges repel) are a ubiquitous physical phenomenon,
which play an important role in materials science. On the one
hand, composite materials with all-in-one functionalities can be
easily fabricated by means of intermolecular electrostatic
interactions, which not only expand the diversity and
functionality of charged AIE systems but also favor the
construction of synergistic theranostic systems (i.e., “1+1>
2”).
51,52 In a recent study, our group fabricated an organic/
inorganic hybrid nanomaterial through the electrostatic
interactions between positively charged AIEgens and negatively
charged 2D nanosheets of black phosphorus.53 Furthermore, we
explored its application in the near-infrared (NIR) ﬂuores-
cence−photothermal dual-imaging-guided synergistic photo-
dynamic−photothermal therapies. On the other hand, positively
charged AIEgens can selectively bind with negatively charged
biological species (e.g., DNA, mitochondrial membranes, and
bacterial membranes) and sensitively probe their residing
microenvironment through real-time ﬂuorescence feedback
(Figure 5 A).
17,25,32,49 Combined the electrostatic interactions
with the TICT e ﬀect, a cationic AIEgen IQ- Cm (chemical
structure in Figure 5 B) could be used to target the negative
surfaces of E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria), S. aureus (Gram-
positive bacteria), and C. albicans (fungi).54 Because of the

distinct membrane structures and membrane compositions, IQ-
Cm exhibited three di ﬀerent “turn-on” ﬂuorescence ( Figure
5C), which was probably attributed to the di ﬀerential binding
sites of these microorganisms. The zeta potential results showed
that in contrast to S. aureus and C. albicans, IQ-Cm signiﬁcantly
neutralized the negative charge of E. coli (Figure 5D), suggesting
the surface association with E. coli and deep penetration into S.
aureus and C. albicans . It is worth noting that by varying the
number and type of the ionic moieties, it is possible to tune the
binding strength and targeting capability of charged AIEgens
toward biological analytes.
33,55,56
4. APPLICATIONS OF CHARGED AIEGENS
By virtue of the unique properties of charged AIEgens, a large
number of applications have been delicately exploited, including
imaging and diagnosis, photodynamic therapy, gas separation,
and solar desalination. These applications are separately
discussed in the following sections.
4.1. Imaging and Diagnosis
Charged AIEgens are ideal materials for imaging and diagnosis
applications due to their tunable targeting capability, high
brightness in aggregates, low background signal, and high
resistance to photobleaching, which are barely seen in traditional
ACQ dyes. On the one hand, charged AIEgens can be used to
monitor complicated cellular processes and re ﬂect key
physiological and pathological changes. 27,39,56 In a recent
study, our group developed a series of pyridinium-containing
AIEgens for the selective identi ﬁcation of cancer cells over
normal cells, which was favorably achieved because of the
diﬀerential mitochondria l membrane potential.
34 Besides,
during photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced cell apoptosis,
these charged AIEgens could undergo mitochondrion-to-
nucleus translocation, enabling in situ monitoring of the PDT
eﬀect through real-time ﬂuorescence signals. In contrast to in
vitro cellular imaging, in vivo bioimaging is particularly
challenging because of the strong tissue absorption, scattering,
and auto ﬂuorescence.
14 To overcome these limitations, we
developed an NIR-emissive charged AIEgen MTTT-BT
(chemical structure in Figure 6 A), which possessed high
ﬂuorescence brightness, a large tissue-penetration depth, and
prominent photoacoustic (PA) signals to facilitate multimodal
in vivo imaging.
57 Featuring a typical D −A structure and an
elongated π-conjugated system, MTTT-BT had an extremely
large Stokes shift (over 240 nm) and strong NIR emission with
the tail extending to the second NIR (NIR-II, 1000 −1700 nm)

region. An in vitro cellular imaging study demonstrated that the
MTTT-BT dots (i.e., nanoaggregates of MTTT-BT with a
hydrodynamic size of ca. 30 nm) could be eﬃ ciently internalized
by 4T1 cells and located in the lysosomes (Figure 6B). An in vivo
imaging study showed that the tumor tissue was speci ﬁcally
visualized by the strong NIR-I, NIR-II, and PA signals even 12 h
postinjection (Figure 6C), indicating the selective accumulation
of the MTTT-BT dots in the tumor site via passive targeting.
4.2. Photodynamic Therapy
In the PDT process, photosensitizers (PSs) in the excited triplet
state undergo either type I (electron transfer) or type II (energy
transfer) photochemical pathways to produce various reactive
oxygen species (ROS) to cause severe cell damage.
31,38,45 Given
the noninvasive nature, spatiotemporal controllability, negligible
drug resistance, low systemic toxicity, and immunostimulatory
activity, PDT has emerged as an e ﬀective modality for the
treatment of cancer and pathogenic infections. Classic ACQ PSs
generally show poor ROS production in aggregates because of
π−π stacking-caused nonradiative decay ( Figure 7 A).58 In
contrast, the nonradiative transition is signiﬁcantly suppressed in
the aggregates of charged AIE PSs due to the restricted
molecular motions. Besides, the energy gap between the singlet
and triplet ( ΔE
st) is also reduced as a result of the strong D −A
interactions.28,36 In this case, the ISC process is remarkably
unlocked, leading to enhanced ROS generation. Moreover, the
electrostatic interactions between positively charged AIEgens
and negatively charged biological species can strengthen their
proximity in 3D space, which maximize the PDT e ﬀect and also
facilitate imaging-guided PDT. In an example, we developed
four charged AIE PSs with diﬀerent degrees of D−A interactions
(TBZPy < MTBZPy < TNZPy < MTNZPy; chemical structure
in Figure 7B).
59 These AIEgens exhibited poor ROS generation
in DMSO due to the active molecular motions ( Figure 7C); on
the contrary, ROS generation was markedly enhanced when
aggregates were formed in aqueous environments ( Figure 7D).
Among them, TNZPy and MTNZPy displayed type-I ROS
generation due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer,
enabling them to photodynamically kill cancer cells both in
normoxia and in hypoxia ( Figure 7 E). In a recent study, we
further extended the application scope of PDT and achieved the
customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms with
AIE polyelectrolytes ( Figure 7F−G), indicating its potential in
tissue engineering and biochips.
4 In addition to single-mode
PDT, we also developed a series of charged AIEgen-based
multimode theranostic materials that integrated PDT with
photothermal therapy,53,60 chemotherapy,61 and/or phagother-
apy,42 which can be used for the establishment of synergistic
therapeutic systems.

is thus of great importance to develop cost-e ﬀective and highly
selective materials for eﬃ cient gas separation. To date, a number
of porous materials have been fabricated, in which gas separation
is fulﬁlled on the basis of the size of gas molecules or their aﬃ nity
for the porous materials. In this aspect, charged AIEgens are
emerging as an attractive candidate for the construction of
porous materials for gas separation. On the one hand, the ionic
interactions among charged AIEgens can facilitate self-assembly
to form stable supramolecular frameworks with tunable pore
sizes.
47,48 On the other hand, the highly polar charged AIEgens
can enhance the separation selectivity by exhibiting a strong
aﬃ nity for polar species.49 Moreover, charged AIEgens typically
exhibit polarity-sensitive emission behaviors,29 which endow the
materials with a vapochrometric capability during gas sorption/
separation and/or porosity transformation to further broaden
their applications. In a recent study, we utilized a linear charged
AIEgen PCS (chemical structure in Figure 8A) as the molecular
brick to construct honeycomb-like supramolecular nanotunnels
(pore size = 6.2 Å) via X-aggregation packing ( Figure 8B,C).
48
The crystal structure of desolvated PCS (PCS D) possessed
excellent thermal and chemical stability, which is rarely seen in
organic supramolecular frameworks. Gas sorption results
conﬁrmed that PCS D absorbed a decent amount of CO 2 (2.8
mmol/g) but only a small amount of CH4 (0.26 mmol/g) under
the conditions of 273 K and 1 bar (Figure 8D). According to the
ideal adsorbed solution theory, the CO 2/CH4 selectivity was
calculated to be 16.8 at 273 K and 7.4 at 298 K ( Figure 8 E),
w h i c hw e r es o m eo ft h eh i g h e s tv a l u e sa m o n go r g a n i c
supramolecular frameworks under identical conditions. Inter-
estingly, six kinds of solvated crystals (PCS S1−PCSS6) were
obtained in di ﬀerent solvents with tunable emission. Notably,
the porosity of these solvated crystals could be reversibly
transformed from the porous crystals to the nonporous
amorphous solid through grinding and vapor fuming, which
was attributed to the dynamic noncovalent interactions. More
importantly, the transformation process could be clearly
visualized by the di ﬀerential emission colors ( Figure 8F,G).
4.4. Solar Desalination
Solar desalination is a technique that utilizes solar energy to
evaporate seawater and obtain fresh water by collecting the
condensed steam, which can potentially address the issue of
global water shortages.
63 One of the critical problems in solar
desalination lies in the development of materials with high solar-
to-thermal conversion e ﬃ ciencies. The intrinsic molecular
rotors in charged AIEgens can favor active molecular motions
when the molecules are loosely packed, leading to the
consumption of the excitation energy via nonradiative decay
and thus the generation of heat.
60 In view of the D −A
interaction-promoted spectral redshift 30 and thus e ﬃ cient
photothermal conversion, charged AIEgens are considered to
be promising candidates for solar desalination. Compared with
traditional photothermal materials (e.g., carbon-based materi-
als), an unparalleled advantage of charged AIEgens is their
adequate solubility in common organic solvents, endowing them
with excellent processability and thus high compatibility with
other manufactured materials. Taking advantage of the broad
absorption in the visible region ( Figure 9 B) as well as the
photothermal eﬀect of MTTT-BT (chemical structure in Figure
9A), we explored its application in solar desalination.
64 First,
MTTT-BT was doped into poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride-co-hexa-
ﬂuoropropylene) to form a 2D electrospun nanoﬁbrous mat and
a 3D all- ﬁber aerogel (AFA, remolded from the 2D mat via
lyophilization). In contrast to the 2D electrospun nano ﬁbrous
mat that had high light re ﬂection and scattering, the 3D AFA
exhibited particularly enhanced light absorption due to the
multiple collision of photons within the porous structure (Figure
9C). Under 1 sun irradiation, the temperature of the 3D AFA
increased to 87 °C within 100 s even without wrapping any

thermal insulation materials (Figure 9D), indicating its potential
in the reduction of heat loss from the irradiated area to the
surrounding aqueous environment. Related experimental results
demonstrated that the 3D AFA exhibited a solar-to-vapor
conversion eﬃ ciency of up to 89% under 1 sun irradiation and an
evaporation rate of 10.9 kg m
−2 day−1 under natural sunlight
(Figure 9 E−G), suggesting its potential in e ﬃ cient solar
desalination.
5. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
As an emerging class of functional materials, charged AIEgens
are attracting increasing attention because of their unique
properties that originate from both AIE and (poly)electrolytes,
including high brightness in aggregates, low background signals,
high resistance to photobleaching, D −A interactions, anion−π
+
interactions, and intermolecular electrostatic interactions. In
this Account, we summarized our recent activities on the study
of charged AIEgens, including the design strategies, unique
properties, and applications in imaging and diagnosis, photo-
dynamic therapy, gas separation, and solar desalination.
Despite these achievements, there is still a large potential for
further investigations of charged AIE systems. First, although
positively charged AIEgens are well established, negatively
charged AIEgens remain largely unexplored because of the
limited type of organic anions. Since negatively charged AIEgens
are expected to display properties distinct from those of the
positive analogs, such as cation −π
− interactions and opposite
recognition behaviors, the development of negatively charged
AIEgens is highly preferred to further expand the application
scope of charged AIEgens. Second, in terms of molecular
topology (e.g., asymmetric, mac rocyclic, helical, star-like,
dendritic, and ladder-like) a nd mesoscale self-assembly
architectures, the family members of charged AIEgens still
need to be enriched, which are critical to the generation of high-
performance materials for a variety of high-technology
applications. Third, charged AIEgens are one of the promising
tools for revealing the mystery of ionic interactions. In a
preliminary study, our group developed two AIEgens with
opposite charges to build a self-reporting system for the
visualization of ionic interactions among electrolytes.
65 Looking
ahead, an increasing number of charged AIE systems should be
exploited to facilitate the understanding of complicated
biological processes and enable a multitude of practical
applications. It is hoped that this Account can spark new ideas
and inspire scientists from diverse disciplines to explore this
nascent yet promising research area.
