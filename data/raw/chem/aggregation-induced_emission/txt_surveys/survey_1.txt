ophy of “reductionism” was thus proposed

are voiced as “a whole can be reduced to
simpler parts, and the whole is the sum of
its individual parts”. This research philos-
ophy works well at the age of the Indus-
trial Revolution when complex machines

of materials has been widely accepted
in organic chemistry. [2] Molecularism

When the properties of an aggregate (whole) are the same as those of its molecular component (part), reductionism is referred to as molecularism.
B) Examples of anti-molecularism systems, where the properties of the aggregates are diametrically opposed to those of their molecular constituents:
(upper)intheACQsystem,themolecularspecies(e.g.,pyrene)inthedilutesolutionsarephotoluminescent,buttheiraggregatesintheaqueousmix tures
with high water fractions (e.g.,fw = 90 vol%) are non-emissive; (lower) in the AIE system, the molecular species (hexaphenylsilole) are non-emissive,
buttheiraggregatesarehighlyphotoluminescent.
macroscopic substances much easier to some extent, and it in-
deedworkswellinexplainingthecomplexchemicalreactionsof
compounds and understanding the reaction mechanism. There
is no doubt that molecules occupy a central position in labora-
tory research; however, it is inappropriate to oversell the role of
molecularstructuresinthecondensedstatewhencomplexaggre-
gations are involved.[3,4] Molecularism takes it for granted that
the properties of aggregates are doubtlessly identical to those
of their constituent molecules (1→ 1). For example, due to
the extended𝜋-conjugation, the polyphenylene vinylene (PPV)
molecule(Figure1A) issemiconductive, and so isits aggregate.
Under excitation, both the molecule and aggregate display sim-
ilar photoluminescence (PL). Moreover, the well𝜋-conjugation
alongtheframeworkendowsthemoleculewithgoodrigidity,and
theaggregateexhibitsrigidityaswell.Conversely,ifoneproperty
is absent in the molecule, so does its aggregate (0→ 0). For in-
stance,polyethyleneglycol(PEG)isnonconductiveinitsmolec-
ularstate, andtheformedaggregatedisplaysthesamefeatures.
Similarly, the molecule and aggregate are both achiral and un-
rigid.
Molecularism is not always idoneous. In many cases, the ag-
gregatesdonotpossessthepropertythatisobservedinmolecular
constituents.[5–7] As shown in Figure1B, the pyrene molecules,
which belong to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) sys-
tem,arehighlyphotoluminescentindilutesolution,buttheirag-
gregatesinaqueousmediaarenon-emissive(1 →0).[8,9] Thereis
alsonolackof0 →1cases,suchasaggregation-inducedemission
(AIE)system.[10,11] Themolecularspeciesofhexaphenylsiloleare
non-emissive,buttheiraggregatesarehighlyphotoluminescent.
Suchanti-molecularismsystemswerediscoveredoveracentury
ago. Apart from PL, many other properties are also changed
after forming aggregates in comparison with their molecular
species.[12–14] For example, phospholipids are water-soluble in
molecular state but their aggregates are water-insoluble.[15] In
biological systems, molecularism encounters a larger challenge
when applied to understanding the complex processes of liv-
ing systems. For instance, it is unreasonable to understand the
characters and behaviors of living aggregates like organs and
life entities, solely based on molecular constituents although
they are constituted by the “dead” molecules.[16–20] Obviously,
the molecularism derived from reductionism is no longer suit-
able for elucidating the structure–property relationship of com-
plex systems, particularly when aggregation is involved. A new
research paradigm that could overcome the dilemma of molec-
ularism and is more suitable for aggregate systems is highly
desirable.
Holism refers to the implication that “a whole is not neces-
sarily determined by its parts alone, and the whole can signif-
icantly aﬀect the behaviors of its parts”.[21] A holistic idea of
“the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” has been ar-
ticulated by Aristotle as early as ancient Greek times. In 1967,
Philip W. Anderson expressed his holism viewpoint: “The be-
havior of large and complex aggregates of elementary parti-
cles is not to be understood in terms of a simple extrapo-
lation of the properties of a few particles”.[22] When an ag-
gregate is formed by the admixture or assembly of molecu-
lar species, its properties may be inﬂuenced by various factors,
including quantity (quantity of components), geometry (size,
shape,anddimension),morphology(amorphousorcrystalline),
and interaction (attraction or repulsion).[23–27] Multifarious in-
terplays (synergism, antagonism, or multiplicity) may coexist in
aggregates.[28–31] Understanding the operations and interplays
within an aggregate system with a holistic perspective is thus
ofbothfundamentalimportanceandpracticalsigniﬁcance. [32,33]
Although the signiﬁcance of holism in aggregate science has
been well recognized, how to investigate complex systems
and understand the macroscopic world with the assistance of
modern characterization technologies still faces tremendous
challenges.

holism, where “A0”a n d“ A1” are the unobservable and observable prop-
erties (A) of dormant (0) and active (1) species, and “A” and “B” are the

Aggregate science emphasizes the signiﬁcance of multibody in-
teractions rather than single molecular structures in determin-
ing the properties or performance of materials, which is just
whatholismadvocates. [11,36] Moreover,thetwistedconﬁgurations
of AIE luminogens render them highly sensitive to subtle alter-
ationsininteractionswithinaggregates,therebyprovidingavalu-
abletoolforinvestigatingtheinﬂuenceofaggregationonmolec-
ularstructureandproperties. [37] However,researchofaggregate
science is still in its infancy, which needs more eﬀort to be de-
voted.

ologies that will guide further research and development of ag-
gregatescience.Asshownin Figure2,threetypesofinﬂuences,

words,aggregationactivates(orwakesup)thedormantmolecu-

ular structure that plays a crucial role in property A will be sta-
bilized by aggregation. Also of note, the aggregation-recovered
property still originates from the molecule itself. In the second
section, we summarize cases of transformation, wherein aggre-
gationchangesthemolecularstructure,moleculararrangement,
and intermolecular interaction, thus inﬂuencing the structure,
behavior, and morphology of aggregates. The behaviors of the
molecularcomponents(A)shifttoBintheaggregatestate,where
“A” and “B” represent the diﬀerent properties before and af-
ter aggregation, respectively. The third section explores the con-
cept of emergence, where the properties are not present at the
molecular level but appear after aggregation (from 0 to 1). The
emergent structures and properties that arise after aggregation
are distinct from those found in their components (molecules
or ions). Finally, in the conclusion and outlook section, various
potentialapplicationsofaggregatescience,includingphotoelec-
tric materials, X-ray scintillators, and pharmaceuticals are ex-
amined. An outlook is also provided on the scope of aggregate
systems,whichincludesmolecularaggregates,ionicaggregates,
and hybrid aggregates. We hope this perspective will provide
some enlightenment and assist the development of aggregate
science.
2.Activation
Activation refers to the process by which aggregation activates
(or“wakesup”)dormantmolecularspecies(fromA0 toA1).Con-
cretely,certainmoleculeshavespeciﬁcpropertiesthatarenotob-
servedinthedilutesolutionstateduetotheactivemolecularmo-
tion.However,whenthesemoleculesaggregate,themostfavor-
ablemolecularconformationforemissionisstabilized,resulting
intheactivationofdormantluminogens. [38–42] Thisphenomenon
is exempliﬁed by the archetypal AIEgen, tetraphenylethylene
(TPE),whichfallsintothecategoryofactivatedluminogens. [43,44]
As shown inFigure 3A, under room temperature (RT), TPE is
nearlynon-emissiveindiluteTHFsolutionbutdisplaysdoughty
blue emission in the crystalline state. The solution could also
exhibit similar blue luminescence as the crystal when cooling
to a cryogenic temperature (77 K). Theoretical simulations re-
veal that excited-state isomerization in the solution accelerates
the rapid nonradiative transition. In contrast, in the crystalline
state,theabundantintermolecularinteractions(suchasCH ···𝜋)
suppress molecular motion, thereby activating the blue emis-
sion via the intramolecular through-space interaction between
two vicinal phenyl rings. Analogously, no measurable emission
couldbeobservedinthedilutesolutionofatypicalrestrictionof
intramolecular vibration-typed AIEgen, cyclooctatetrathiophene
(CoTh) (Figure3B).[45] But noticeable green luminescence re-
covers after freezing the molecule, which is also similar to the
property in its crystalline state. The activation process can be
monitoredusingcirculardichroism(CD)spectroscopyduetothe
stereoisomeric properties of CoTh. At RT, the CD signals of the
two enantiomers in THF solutions gradually decreased upon ir-
radiation, indicative of the active vibration of CoTh molecules.
Conversely,nochangeintheCDsignalsisobservedinthesolid
state,suggestingthataggregationeﬀectivelysuppressesmolecu-
lar vibration. Theoretical simulations elucidate the mechanism,
in which through-space conjugation within the crystal is stabi-
lized by intermolecular interactions, allowing for the activation
of green emission. These observations indicate that the lumi-
nescence of TPE and CoTh is indeed activated by aggregation,
and the emission of their aggregates originates directly from
themolecules themselves. Theinternal mechanism ofthisphe-
nomenon can be further explained as follows: at RT, the active
molecular motion in dilute solution disrupts the homoconjuga-
tionsbetweenadjacentaromaticrings,facilitatingthenonradia-
tive decay and preventing the formation of an eﬀective conjuga-
tion for emission. As a result, the molecule remains dormant.
Oppositely, as illustrated in Figure3C, aggregation stabilizes
the homoconjugations, leading to the recovery of emission.[46]
The activation of luminescence in AIEgens, achieved by sup-
pressing molecular motion, provides a powerful tool for visu-
alizing dynamic processes in materials science and biological
systems.[47–49]
3.Transformation
Transformation denotes that aggregation changes the behaviors
of the molecular components (from A to B). Transformation oc-
curs when aggregation induces changes in molecular compo-
nents, such as the conformation, arrangement, and intermolec-
ular interactions of the individual parts, ultimately inﬂuencing

the structure, morphology, and behavior of the aggregates.[50–52]
For example, Zhao and coworkers reported a molecule of BISX
that emits weak orange light in a dilute THF solution at RT.[53]
Withtheadditionofwater,aggregatesformed,andtheemission
intensity gradually increased, suggesting its typical AIE prop-
erty (Figure4A,B). To investigate the AIE mechanism, PL spec-
tra in a dilute solution under a cryogenic temperature (77 K)
are measured. In contrast to the green emission of aggregate,
only short emission peaks at 433 and 460 nm appeared. The-
oretical calculations reveal that the upper and lower rings are
perpendiculartoeachotherinsolution,resultinginnearlynon-
overlapped HOMO and LUMO electrons. While aggregation
changes the conformation, allowing more eﬀective HOMO and
LUMO overlap and eﬀective electrons transition. Such a phe-
nomenon could be attributed to the dependence of homocon-
jugation formation in diphenylmethane with an appropriate di-
hedralangle(Figure 4C).[54–56] Eﬀectivehomoconjugationexists
when the angle between two aromatic rings is twisted and the
p-orbitals overlap. As displayed in Figure4C,D, in solution, the
upperandlowerringsareperpendiculartoeachother( 𝜃=90°),

Aggregation aﬀects not only luminescence but also inﬂu-
ences other properties.[57] Polymorphism, with multiple pack-
ing modes, morphologies, and properties, is one of the com-
monly observed phenomena in aggregate state and serves as a
suitable platform to investigate the transformation in aggregate
science.[58–60] TheBNAmoleculecanformtwotypesofcrystals:

the BNA-𝛽crystal to relieve strain (Figure5F). In this polymor-

In addition to changing molecular structures and packing
modes, aggregation could transform molecular hydrophilicity
into aggregate hydrophobicity (from A to B). For example,
as shown in Figure 6A, a polarity-sensitive AIEgen (TVPV)
displays gradually blue-shifted emission corresponding to the

decreased polarity of the polymer matrix.[62] Meanwhile, during
the hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity transformation of chitosan,
TVPV initially exhibits a weak and red emission color in the
aqueous environment due to the twisted intramolecular charge
transfer eﬀect. Upon gelation, the inner environment of chi-
tosan changes from high-polar hydrophilicity to less-polar
hydrophobicity, resulting in a blue-shifted and intensiﬁed lu-
minescence of TVPV. This phenomenon indicates TVPV serves
as an appropriate probe to detect the transformation from
hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide
(PNIPAM) is a typical temperature-sensitive polymer.[63] The
temperature-resulting phase transition of PNIPAM is a kind of
transformation from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity caused by
aggregation. At 20°C, TVPA-incorporated PNIPAM exhibits a

such as the hydrophilicity–hydrophobicity change before and

andtherapyofvariousdiseasesinthebiologicalﬁeld. [64]
4.Emergence
Emergence refers to the phenomenon whereby aggregation
brings about emergent properties absent at the molecular level
(from 0 to 1). Apart from activating dormant molecular species
and changing part’s structures to endow the whole with new
properties,aggregationalsocouldgenerateemergentproperties
the molecules lacked. Clusteroluminescence describes the lu-
minescence phenomenon of molecules without through-bond
𝜋-conjugation.[65] Usually, no emission could be observed for
these clusteroluminogens in dilute solution due to the absence
of conjugated chromophore, while their aggregates could ex-
hibit bright luminescence covering the full spectrum.[66–69] For
example, L-lysine, as reported by Yuan, is totally non-emissive
in a dilute solution (0.08 mM) either at RT or low tempera-
ture (Figure 7A).[70] However, bright sky-blue luminescence
appears at aggregate state or at high concentration (100 mM).
AsdisplayedinFigure 7B,thereasonfortheemergenceofclus-
teroluminescence by aggregation could be distinctly elucidated
bythecrystalstructure.Therearemultipleinter/intramolecular
through-space interactions (like N ─H···O═C, C ─H···O═C,
H─C···O═C, C─H···𝜋(C═O), and C─H···𝜋(C═O)) within the
crystal. These multifarious weak interactions are conducive to
rigidifying the crystal structures. Meanwhile, clusterolumino-
gen (CLgen) is generated by the multiple inter/intramolecular
n–n electron interactions (C─N···O═Ca n dC═O···O═C), n–𝜋
(C═O···𝜋(C═O)), and𝜋–𝜋(𝜋(C═O)···𝜋(C═O)),thereby realizing
clusteroluminescence. The excitation-dependent luminescence
implies the new structures are emergent in an aggregate state.
Besidesthesmallmoleculeofaminoacid,clusteroluminescence

traditional perception that luminescence necessitates extended
𝜋-conjugation structure, thereby generating a new mechanism
intheaggregatestate.
Comparedwithnaturalpolymers,syntheticoneswiththemer-
its of easily modiﬁed structures, abundant functions, and ex-
cellent performances, have greatly promoted the development
of human civilization.[75,76] Clusteroluminescence is also fre-
quently observed in synthetic polymers. For example, polyacry-
lonitrile (PAN), extensively used in clothes, is non-emissive in
dilute solution (0.1 mM) either at RT or 77 K, but shows bright
luminescence in high concentration (500 mM) and aggregate
(Figure8A).[77] The emergent clusteroluminescence is ascribed
totheformedCLgensthroughthe n–n, n–𝜋,and 𝜋–𝜋interactions
amongcyanogroups(Figure 8B).Actually,clusteroluminescence
is commonly exited in most synthetic polymers that are free
of extended through-bond𝜋-conjugation but contain lone pair
electrons.Figure 8Cillustratessometypicalsyntheticpolymers,
including polyether, polyamide, polyester, polycarbonate, poly-
monothiocarbonate,andpolyanhydride. [78–81] Allofthemfeature

In addition to organic systems, emergence also widely ex-
istsinorganic–inorganichybridandinorganicsubstances. [82–87]
TPPGPA represents an organogold complex whose PL spec-
tra can’t be measured both at 293 and 77 K in dilute solution
(10−5 M),indicativeofitsnon-luminescentnatureatthemolecu-
larlevel( Figure9A).[88] However,theluminescenceofTPPGPA
is intensiﬁed with increasing concentration at 77 K, on account
of the gradual formation of clusters (Figure9B). As shown in
Figure9C,thecrystalofTPPGPAexhibitsbrightwhiteclustero-
luminescence after crystallization. Analysis of the crystal struc-
tureofTPPGPAmanifeststhatthrough-spaceaurophilicAu ⋅⋅⋅Au
interaction is formed in the organogold cluster and thus new
structure is brought about by aggregation. Notably, the Au⋅⋅⋅Au
interaction is disrupted upon dissolution in solution, and the
organogold cluster returns to a dispersed state, indicating its
uniquereversiblefeature.
Inorganic substances have more abundant types but little re-
search about their clusteroluminescence property has been car-
ried out yet.[89] Unlike organic molecules, many inorganic com-
pounds couldn’t be expressed by deﬁnite molecular structures,
namely their components are not molecules. For example, as
showninFigure 9C,noPLsignalisdetectedfromthediluteso-
lutionofPbBr 2 inDMSOatbothRTand77K,demonstratingthe
non-emissivenatureofisolatedionsofPb 2+ andBr −.[90] Interest-
ingly,astheconcentrationincreasesatRT,thePbBr 2 dispersion
inDMSOexhibitsgraduallyincreasedluminescence(Figure 9D).
This arises from the emergent interactions between the ions of
Pb2+ and Br−. Furthermore, the ionic salt crystal grown from
the DMSO solution exhibits a red-shifted clusteroluminescence
color, on account of the formation of a 1D polymer chain of
(PbBr2)n inthecrystalstructure,whichextendstheelectrondelo-
calization(Figure 9G,H).Inshort,regardlessofwhethertheyare
organic, organic–inorganic hybrid, or inorganic matters, emer-
gence from 0 to 1 extensively exists. Simple extrapolation from
thetotallynon-emissivemoleculesorions,orresearchfroma“re-
ductionism” approach, couldn’t understand the emergent prop-
erties in aggregate. Owing to the emergent new structures, the
aggregate’s properties are totally diﬀerent from the individual
parts.
5.ConclusionsandOutlook
The single molecule and its associated epistemology are essen-
tial elements in the ﬁeld of physical science. However, they do
not encompass all aspects, and the properties of aggregates are
inﬂuenced only partially by the molecular components. Adopt-
ing a holistic perspective, the relationship between the overall
structure and properties of a system should be examined not
only at the molecular level but also at the aggregate level. Three
possible inﬂuences of aggregation on substance properties (ac-
tivation, transformation, and emergence) have been discussed
above, but noteworthily more types may also exist. Many typical
AIEgens,suchasTPEandCoth,fallintotheactivationtype.They
are dormant in dilute solution because active molecular motion
disrupts the homoconjugations and prevents the formation of

In some new AIEgen like BISX, the transformation of molecu-
lar structure induced by aggregation accounts for the AIE prop-
erty.Apartfromalteringmolecularstructuresandpackingmod-

The exploration of the aggregation eﬀect on molecular struc-
ture and property endows aggregate science with great ap-
plication potential for the scenario in which materials work
in an aggregate state.[91–93] By regulating the packing behav-
iors, the diﬀerent structures and properties could be realized
at the aggregate level with the same molecule, allowing for
applications in various scenarios. For example, Fu et al. re-
ported a molecule𝛽-acetylnaphthalene chelate (𝛽CBF2) which
could form J- aggregation (green crystal) and H-aggregation
(red crystal) via adjusting the conformations and packing ar-
rangements (Figure 10A–D).[92] J-aggregation reduces the en-
ergy gap between the singlet and triplet states for ultrafast re-
verse intersystem crossing (RISC), exhibiting thermally acti-
vated delayed ﬂuorescence property (Figure10E). While the in-
tersystem crossing (ISC) is accelerated in H-aggregation, con-
tributing to realize RT phosphorescence (RTP) (Figure10F).
This case supports that aggregation enables the rational regu-
lation of molecular excited-state properties, allowing for mul-
tiple applications like organic light-emitting diodes and high-
contrast bioimaging.[94,95] X-ray scintillators could convert high-
energy X-rays into low-energy visible light, exhibiting a wide
range of potential applications in medical radiography, secu-
rityinspection,spaceexploration,etc.Theacquirementofhigh-
performance scintillating aggregate materials thus is crucial
for radiography and radiation detection. Huang and coworkers
developed a molecule 10-(pyrimidine-2-yl)-10H-phenothiazine
(MN), demonstrating that the phosphorescent scintillation per-
formancecouldbeeﬀectivelyoptimizedbycontrollingthepack-
ingstructuresandintermolecularinteractionsinaggregatestate
(Figure 10G,H).[93] The crystals (MN-T) with stronger inter-
molecular 𝜋∙∙∙𝜋interactions achieved a low detection limit of
278nGys −1.Meanwhile,high-performanceX-rayradiographyof
the encapsulated metallic spring and the black plastic box con-
taining the metal sheet also can be realized, indicative of the
signiﬁcance of interplays within aggregates on X-ray scintilla-
tor performance (Figure10I–L). Aggregate science also assists
in the improvement of pharmaceutical eﬀect by the synergistic
eﬀect of multicomponents within the aggregates.[96] For exam-
ple, Cai et al. employed theophylline (Thp) to cocrystallize with
two ﬂavonoid compounds apigenin (Agn) and daidzein (Dai).
Compared with the parent ﬂavonoids, Agn/Thp and Dai/Thp
cocrystals exhibit better solubilities, intrinsic dissolution rates,
and permeabilities, demonstrating the synergistic eﬀect in ag-
gregate provides a new viewpoint to study the pharmacological
action.[97]
Aggregate science emphasizes a holistic approach to ex-
ploring the structures–properties relationship of substances,
which can oﬀer new perspectives for researchers in related
ﬁelds. For instance, when materials researchers explore the

attention should also be paid to the inﬂuences of various inter-

andthescreeningofperovskiteadditives, [90] canbeexpanded.
The types of aggregates also vary and are versatile accord-
ing to the constituted components (Figure11). For example, or-
ganicaggregatescouldbeaggregatesformedbysinglemolecular
species or two-component molecular aggregates (cocrystal).[100]
On the other hand, the category of aggregates is not only
limited to organic systems but also includes inorganic sys-
temsandorganic–inorganichybridsystems.[101] Thetotallynon-
luminescent ions formed ionic aggregates, such as𝛾-CsPbBr3
and MtnPt(CN)4 (Mt =Ba, n =1; K,n =2), could exhibit bright
emission.[85,102,103] When the parts are non-emissive molecules
and ions (like TPE4TA and Ag+), PL turns on in the formed
organic–inorganic hybrid aggregate (like TPE4TA-Ag+).[104–106]
Therefore, these aggregates could be single components, two
components, or more components; they can also be homoge-
neousorheterogeneous. [107–109] Additionally,thenewproperties
ofaggregatesmayincludenotonlyluminescencebutalsochiral-
ity, reactivity, photothermy, and more.[110–116] Guided by holism,
new models, hypotheses, mechanisms, and knowledge will be
generated, contributing to the understanding of macroscopic
substancesandnaturalprocesses.Theestablishmentofnewfun-
damental principles and laws will enable the reasonable design
