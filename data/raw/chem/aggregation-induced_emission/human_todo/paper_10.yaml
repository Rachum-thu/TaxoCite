  content: Biomimetic exploration of stimuli-responsive and crack-resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance,
    although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging
    techniques to “see” hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response
    is designed by incorporating aggregation- and polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)
    network grafted with poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) side-chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool
    to directly visualize their hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity transformation and the composition-dependent microphase separation.
    Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive
    mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of
    multiple non-covalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack
    multifurcation is related to the tearing-like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

    the environment. Many recent technologies are based on hydrogel responsiveness and tunable mechanical properties. [9,10]
    Although a deep understanding of the relationship between their molecular structure, supramolecular interactions, and
    mechanical behavior remains a big challenge, it is still fascinating for synthetic scientists and engineers to develop
    bioinspired high-strength and stimuli-responsive hydrogels. [11]


    To meet the ever-increasing requirements, continuous effort has been devoted to the development of high-strength hydrogels.
    [12,13] Among them, the design original polymer network topologies, as double-networks, [14] sliding-ring networks,[15]
    tetra-poly(ethylene glycol) networks, [16] or the introduction of structural and dynamical heterogeneities, as in nanocomposite
    gels, [17,18] have shown significant mechanical enhancement than their conventional counterparts. Despite these great
    achievements, biomimetic approach can offer a broad platform to explore energy dissipation pathways for crack-resistant
    hydrogels. [19,20] Recently, protein-inspired phase-separated hydrogels have been proved to enhance the toughness of polymer
    networks. [21,22] A systematic crack bifurcation has been also reported to prevent crack fracture of the whole phase-separated
    hydrogels, which is promising to mimic the tearing behavior in hydrogels (Figure 1b). [23] To describe such behavior of
    sacrificing the noncovalent interactions or weak interfaces to preserve the integrity of the whole, morphomechanics is
    proposed here to draw on the mechanical breakage of intramolecular bonds in mechanochemistry. [24] While the network topology
    and fiber-like formation of phase-separated domains, appears to be a key-aspect on fracture toughness enhancement, [25,26]
    the observation of the phase separation morphology and the understanding of the strengthening mechanism are still insufficient.
    Moreover, the current understanding of toughening scenarios is often deduced from the chemical nature of network structure
    and the macroscopic properties. [27–29] So far, the coupling effects due to noncovalent interactions and morphological
    structures on the mechanical property are still under debate due to the lack of mesoscale imaging techniques. It appears
    essential to develop effective techniques to “see” the mesoscale morphologies in various hydrated states and to clarify
    their roles in fracture toughening. [30,31]


    In this framework, many modern microscopic techniques including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
    and atomic force microscopy are inadequate. These cost and time-consuming imaging techniques are generally performed in
    a vacuum state and have destructive sample preparation processes. On the contrary, fluorescence technique offers a direct
    approach to visualize the analytes in a simple, sensitive, high-contrast, and onsite manner. However, many traditional
    fluorophores exhibit weak or no emission in the solid state and aqueous environment due to the aggregation-caused quenching
    effect. [32] Fortunately, this negative effect can be overcome by luminogens (AIEgens) with aggregation-induced emission
    (AIE), which are generally non-emissive in dilute solutions but emit intensely in the aggregated state due to the restriction
    of intramolecular motions. [33] AIEgens are often embedded with electron-donating (D) and accepting (A) units to trigger
    polarity-responsive emission change assisted by the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. [34] Herein,
    we developed a new polymerizable fluorescent probe with AIE and TICT characters for the direct visualization of microphase
    separation patterns and hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity transformation in thermoresponsive composite hydrogels. Combined
    with their mechanical behaviors, thermoresponsive toughening, and crack multi-bifurcation, we gain a deep understanding
    of their structure–property relationships and propose a detailed strengthening mechanism of hydrogels.'

  content: 'To visualize the morphological change of stimuli-responsive hydrogels, we designed and synthesized a new water-soluble
    AIEgen named TVPA with the chemical structure shown in Figure 2a. The electron-donating triphenylamine and the electron-withdrawing
    pyridinium unit are connected to the ethylene core, which endows TVPA with molecular rotors, a D−A structure, and ionic
    character. The three-step synthetic route is provided in Figure S1, Supporting Information. The reaction intermediates
    and TVPA were fully characterized by NMR and mass spectroscopies (Figure S2−S9, Supporting Information). The theoretical
    frontier molecular orbital distribution was calculated by density functional theory calculations [m062x/6-311G (d, p)].
    As shown in Figure 2a, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) mainly localizes in the triphenylamine unit and the
    lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) mainly locates in the pyridinium unit. Such electron separation of HOMO and
    LUMO indicates a π–π* transition with a charge transfer character.


    The photoluminescence (PL) and the quantum yields (QYs) in water, glycerol, and the solid state of TVPA were first investigated
    to verify the desired optical properties. As shown in Figure 2b, the water-soluble TVPA exhibits weak red emission in
    dilute aqueous solution but emits intensely in viscous glycerol and in the solid state with 87 and 54 times higher intensity,
    respectively. The corresponding QYs of TVPA are also increased from 0.4% to 10.7% and 6.1%, respectively, confirming the
    AIE characteristic of TVPA because of the restriction of intramolecular motions. Considering the D−A structure of TVPA,
    we recorded its PL spectra and fluorescent photos in different solvents and polymer films with various polarities. Figure
    2c demonstrates the remarkable solvatochromic effect of TVPA: its emission color gradually shifts from blue (λem = 436
    nm) to red (λem = 610 nm) when the solvent is changed from non-polar toluene to polar methanol. The TVPA-doped polymer
    films also display the same bathochromic shift from blue emission (λem = 457 nm) in non-polar polybutadiene to red emission
    (λem = 621 nm) in polar PEG (Figure 2d). Such polarity-responsive behaviors clearly manifest the TICT characteristic of
    TVPA. In short, we successfully synthesized a AIEgen with desired strong emission in the aggregated state and high sensitivity
    to environmental polarity. From synthetic prospective, acrylate-containing TVPA probe is promising to be covalently incorporated
    in polymer network by olefinic polymerization in aqueous media. Such characteristics make it a promising fluorescent sensor
    to the crowdedness and polarity change in macromolecular systems.'

  content: 'Based on the previous efforts in phase-separated hydrogels, we attempted to incorporate TVPA in the chemically
    crosslinked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) side-chains
    as schematically illustrated in Figure 3a. The PDMA macromonomer was synthesized according to the procedure reported in
    Figure S10, Supporting Information. Gels synthesis was carried out in water. 2 mm thick hydrogel plates were prepared
    by free radical copolymerization of NIPAM, TVPA, PDMA macromonomer, and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as chemical
    crosslinker using a redox initiation at room temperature with potassium peroxodisulfate and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine.
    We anticipated that the copolymer network can alternate from the as-prepared homogeneous state at room temperature to
    a biphasic state under thermal stimulus above the lower critical solution temperature of PNIPAM (LCST, Tc ≈ 32 °C) and
    back to the homogeneous state below the LCST. [35] Indeed, the well-hydrated PNIPAM chains should undergo a coil-to-globule
    transition and collapse into PNIPAM-rich hydrophobic domains above the LCST. At the same time, the water released is absorbed
    by the hydrophilic PDMA phase which thus makes it possible to preserve the swelling of the gel (as polymer concentration)
    at macroscopic scale by osmotic contribution. Thus, from preparation state, gels can undergo microphase separation at
    almost constant macroscopic volume for T > Tc. Meanwhile, the covalently incorporated TVPA is expected to exhibit fluorescence
    in terms of both intensity and color changes, from weakly red-emissive in the extended hydrophilic PNIPAM chains to intensively
    blue-emissive in the crowded hydrophobic PNIPAM-rich domains. Using this design principle, three hydrogels (GN2D3, GN3D3,
    and GN6D3) were achieved from N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM,N) network and grafted PDMA macromonomers (D) with different
    weight ratios (N/D: 2/3, 3/3, and 6/3) while keeping the same PNIPAm network (content and cross-link density) (Figure
    S11 and Table S1, Supporting Information). For comparison purposes, GN and GD hydrogels were prepared from NIPAM and N,N-dimethylacrylamide
    with TVPA, respectively.


    The macroscopic properties of three hydrogels were investigated at different temperatures by swelling experiments, transmittance,
    and PL measurements. Starting from the as-prepared (reference) state, as expected, the three hydrogels largely swell when
    equilibrated in water at 20 °C and the level of swelling at equilibrium increases with the PDMA content (Figure S12, Supporting
    Information). In comparison, the swelling of hydrogels equilibrated at 60 °C remains closer to the reference state, either
    above, similar, or below for GN2D3, GN3D3, and GN6D3, respectively. Such swelling behavior implies that they successfully
    inherit the thermoresponsive properties from LCST-type PNIPAM and their swelling ability is tunable by changing the weight
    fraction of PNIPAM and PDMA. From the absorption spectra, the change in transmittance at 600 nm was determined as a function
    of temperature between 20 and 60 °C (Figure S13, Supporting Information). For all the samples, GN2D3, GN3D3, and GN6D3,
    the transmittance drops dramatically between 24 and 34 °C with a visible change from transparent to opaque. This macroscopic
    observation, common to the three hydrogels, clearly indicates the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous system
    due the formation of PNIPAM-rich domains above their LCST. [36]


    As the incorporation of TVPA into the hydrogels provides direct access to the fluorescence technique in hydrogels, we
    carefully studied the PL of the three hydrogels in the preparation state and after heating in water for 30 min. As indicated
    in Figure 3b, all the PL spectra of GN2D3, GN3D3, and GN6D3 display remarkable both intensity and color changes at Tc.
    By heating from 20 to 60 °C, the PL intensity increases by up to 17 times and the PL maximum shifts from 620 to 480 nm.
    The reversible fluorescence change between dark orange (20 °C) and bright blue (60 °C) is observable by naked eyes. Among
    the three hydrogels, GN6D3 with the highest composition of PNIPAM shows strongest intensity enhancement owing to its slight
    macroscopic shrinkage. GN2D3 has the largest blue shift to 470 nm, which indicates that PNIPAM chains have collapsed into
    strongly dehydrated and dense domains. To better understand the source of fluorescence change, we studied the PL of GN
    and GD at 20 and 60 °C. As shown in Figure 3c,d, the temperature only exerts a strong influence on the fluorescence of
    GN. The emission color of GN at the temperature above Tc is close to that of traditional non-polar polymers. Referring
    to the AIE and TICT characteristics of TVPA probe, such enhanced and blue-shifted fluorescence underlines the coil-to-globule
    conformational change and implies the transformation from hydrophilic PNIPAM chains into hydrophobic PNIPAM domains above
    the LCST. In other words, TVPA can serve as a simple and effective reporter to micro-environmental changes in hydrogels,
    especially to the transformation from molecular hydrophilicity to morphological hydrophobicity.


    To demonstrate this newly proposed concept, additional proof-of-concept experiments were performed on stimuli-responsive
    gelation of TVPA-containing synthetic polymers, synthetic-natural complex and natural polymers. In Figure 3e, the thermo-responsive
    gelation of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-PPG-PEG) solution displays
    a gradual blue-shifted emission when its aqueous solution is heated, traducing dehydration level. A mixture of weakly
    red-emissive α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) and PEG solutions turns into a hydrogel after the formation of an inclusion complex
    α-CD-PEG, which exhibits a strong orange emission (Figure 3f). Again, with the diffusion of sodium hydroxide, the chitosan
    solution gradually gels with the shift of the emission color from red to orange (Figure 3g). Collectively, these emission
    behaviors show that TVPA can sensitively detect both environmental concentration and polarity changes, respectively by
    intensity and color-shift emission, taking place in stimuli-responsive hydrogels. More generally, the TVPA probe allows
    for probing the hydrophilic-hydrophobic transformation in biological macromolecular systems and would make it possible
    to assess the transition level through the polarity of the environment as a function of the emission color.'

  content: 'Based on the preliminary results, the fluorescence microscope was employed to systematically investigate the thermoresponsive
    morphology of the hydrogels at the mesoscopic scale (Figure S14, Supporting Information). The GN3D3 hydrogel, selected
    as representative sample for the analysis of thermal effect, was studied a) in the preparation state, b) after immersing
    in water at 60 °C for 30 min, and c) after overnight recovery at 20 °C, respectively. Under thermal cycling, fluorescent
    images of GN3D3 switch reversibly between chromatic-orange and chromatic-blue emission, which is consistent with the macroscopic
    observation. The appearance of Newton’s rings with multicolor fringes illustrates the existence of light interference.
    By applying simple optics principles, [37] we can draw two guidelines: 1) the numbers of interference fringes in Newton’s
    rings are positively correlated with the actual size of the corresponding objects; 2) the distance between two constructive
    fringes of same color, called as fringe spacing, depends on the refractive index of local polymer domains. The role of
    light interference in the optical observation of the fluorescent composite hydrogels is interpretated in detail (Figure
    S15, Supporting Information). The interference patterns in Figure 4a display continuous irregular combinations of Newton’s
    rings, which are associated with some spatial heterogeneities distribution of partially hydrated polymer phase and aqueous
    phase trapped during polymerization. [38] Noted that a morphological pattern with two distinct regions in Figure 4b is
    generated by heating GN3D3 above the LCST while its volume change at the macroscopic level is almost negligible. Region
    I displays plenty of strongly emissive spherical domains, which result from the large difference in refractive index between
    polymer concentrated domains (PNIPAM-rich) and water (or highly hydrated polymer regions). Region II is a more uniform
    pattern displaying weakly emissive matrix corresponding to the domains where the highly hydrated PDMA domains exhibit
    a refractive index comparable to water. Such assignment of region I and region II are supported by further comparison
    with the morphologies of GD and GN after immersing in water at 60 °C (Figure S16, Supporting Information). After the thermal
    cycling, an entire Newton’s ring spreads over the entire area in the recovered pattern with relatively wide fringe spacing,
    suggesting a more homogenous network produced by rehydration of PNIPAM domains and rearrangement of both PDMA and PNIPAM
    chains (Figure 4c). By immersing GN3D3 in water at different temperatures, the scale of phase transition and the size
    of PNIPAM-rich domains are continuously increasing from 25 to 65 °C (Figure S16, Supporting Information). This series
    of interference patterns obtained by thermal cycling demonstrates the reliability of fluorescent observations and the
    reversibility of the system.


    The fluorescence images of GN2D3, GN3D3, and GN6D3 were then taken to compare the impact of gel topology over the microphase
    separation patterns. As presented in Figure 4d–i, the ratio of PNIPAM network and PDMA grafts exerts a great influence
    on the phase-separated morphologies. In GN2D3 with PDMA as the major component, a uniform dispersion of the PDMA-rich
    matrix with isolated PNIPAM-rich spherical domains is observed. From GN2D3 to GN3D3, the content of hydrophilic grafts
    is decreased, and the PNIPAM-rich spherical domains appear to be more interconnected. The picture for GN6D3 appears more
    complex with even larger polymer-rich domains interconnected. From the morphological changes, we deduce that the PNIPAM
    network collapses through the pearl necklace-like formation of intrachain micelles and the spacer between micelles becomes
    closer as the content of hydrophilic PDMA grafts decreases. In fact, these phase-separated patterns provide good experimental
    evidence for the theoretical models of sparsely grafted amphiphilic copolymer self-assemblies. [39] In terms of Newton’s
    rings assigned to PNIPAM-rich domains, the numbers of interference fringe and the fringe spacing gradually increase from
    GN2D3, GN3D3 to GN6D3. This suggests that the PNIPAM-core micelles become larger and more uniform with increasing composition
    of PNIPAM. These observations demonstrate that the AIE-assisted fluorescent imaging offers a simple, high-contrast, and
    onsite access to visualize stimuli-responsive morphological variations and differentiate the composition-dependent phase-separated
    patterns. In this way, fluorescence technique affords a new way of revealing mesostructures in hydrogels which had never
    been observed so far.'

  content: 'After exploring the stimuli-responsive and composition-dependent microphase separation of GN2D3, GN3D3, and GN6D3,
    we investigate the impact of such morphologies on the mechanical behavior. The temperature-induced viscoelastic properties
    were first studied under small deformations, probing the mechanical response of gel’s microstructure without strong perturbations
    from its conformation at rest. Note that samples were tested under isolated conditions, that is, immersed in paraffin
    oil, to prevent water evaporation or swelling during experiment. The frequency-dependence of their viscoelastic behaviors
    at 20 and 60 °C was examined to verify their temperature-dependent viscoelastic moduli (Figure S17, Supporting Information).
    Then the thermo-responsive mechanical properties at small deformations were measured by temperature sweep at a constant
    frequency (f = 1 rad s−1). As illustrated in Figure 5a, heating the hydrogel samples from 20 to 60 °C triggers a dramatic
    increase of the elastic modulus (G′) corresponding to the emergence and progress of microphase separation, where the elastic
    PNIPAM network collapses into a stiffened phase. The rheological measurement under heating and cooling process shows excellent
    superposition performance, implying the recovery and stability of the system at a slow rate of temperature change (0.25
    °C min−1). As expected from optical observation of phase-separated patterns, the addition of PDMA grafts implies a limitation
    of phase separation domains—from virtually continuous to more isolated domains—and results in a decreased reinforcement
    efficiency, in terms of G′ for T > Tc. Sufficiently far from Tc, the contribution of dissipative contribution remains
    quite low, the loss modulus (G′′) being one order of magnitude lower than G′.


    We then investigated the large strain behaviors of GN2D3, GN3D3, and GN6D3 at 20 and 60 °C by tensile stress–strain measurements
    (Figure 5b–d and Figure S18 and S19, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 5b, at 20 °C, all the samples show the
    typical response of lightly covalently crosslinked polymer networks. Indeed, the PNIPAM network below Tc is supposed to
    feature entropy-driven elasticity. At 20 °C, Young’s modulus (E) is rather similar, independently of network topologies,
    and the obtained values are in line with viscoelastic data (E ≅ 3G′). Conversely, at 60 °C stress–strain curves significantly
    overestimate the purely entropic contribution of the network at 20 °C. Such remarkable changes on fracture strain and
    stress are ascribed to the conformational entanglement of the collapsed PNIPAM chains and the formation of multiple noncovalent
    interactions in PNIPAM domains above LCST, respectively. GN6D3 displays the highest E of 18.3 kPa at 60 °C, which is consistent
    with the role of PNIPAM as a thick continuous matrix as observed at mesoscale. In addition, an interesting crack deflection
    occurs when stretching GN6D3 to large strain. To graphically depict their divergence from entropy-driven elasticity, stress–strain
    behaviors have been plotted as reduced stress versus reciprocal elongation (1/λ) according to semi-empirical model. [40]
    As shown in Figure 5d, the almost horizontal lines at 20 °C indicate that their original mechanical performance is dominated
    by entropic elasticity. In contrast, at 60 °C their reduced stress (1/λ) curves obviously deviate from entropic elasticity,
    displaying roughly softening and hardening behaviors. The softening behavior is contributed from the disruption of noncovalent
    interactions that dissipate energy during the unraveling of the collapsed PNIPAM network from globule conformation to
    stretched state. After the consumption of physical associations, the polymer chains are oriented and aligned along the
    stretching direction and account for the final hardening behavior before fracture.


    Tensile tests on notched specimen were performed at 60 °C to focus on the crack propagation and fracture toughening mechanisms.
    The notch was made with a razor blade to initiate the crack propagation where the notch induces high strain amplification.
    The tensile stress–strain curves are plotted in Figure 5e and the corresponding stretching processes are recorded using
    pictures and videos (Videos S1–S3, Supporting Information). All GNxDy topologies exhibit strong resistance to crack propagation
    by shielding the crack tip singularity: first by crack blunting, followed by systematic crack furcation perpendicularly
    to the plane of the notch. Interestingly, pre-notched specimens sustain higher fracture stresses than their un-notched
    counterparts, suggesting that toughening mechanisms are operating more efficiently under severe loading, as knotty-tearing
    fracture mode in natural rubbers. [41] GN2D3 with pre-crack displays blunting and one crack deflection along the stretching
    direction. GN3D3 displays three consecutive crack deflections and GN6D3 is further developed into crack multifurcation,
    that is, five crack branches are noticed. This multifurcation behavior exactly mimics the tearing behavior of fibrillar
    tissues and inherits the advantage of keeping the integrity of the material as much as possible. In laminate materials,
    theoretical criterion for crack deflection is reached when the adhesive energy of the interface becomes less than the
    cohesive energy in a certain ratio. [42] In our case, as the composition of PNIPAM increases from GN2D3 to GN6D3, the
    cohesive energy of hydrogels is intensified and the opportunity of encountering the PNIPAM/PDMA interfaces along the crack
    path also raises. This explains the increasing process of crack multifurcation observed from GN2D3, GN3D3 to GN6D3. The
    fracture energies of notched specimens, which describe the strain energy required to propagate the crack across hydrogels,
    have been estimated. With crack multifurcation, GN6D3 displays the highest fracture energy at around 800 J m−2. This is
    a quite high value considering the high hydration level of the gel, as the fracture energy for unfilled rubber is around
    1000 J m−2. The key-point, here, relies on multiple fracture surface area that is generated during the failure process
    as additional energy dissipation pathway which resembles the fiber-assembled biological tissues. Acquiring such ability
    to resist crack penetration and maintain the integrity of the entire body by partial sacrifice in strengthened hydrogels
    are of great significance for material engineering and practical applications.'

  content: 'Based on the above studies, going from microscopic hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity transformation to mesoscopic
    morphological variation and up to macroscopic mechanical performance, we propose a toughening mechanism as illustrated
    in Figure 6. So far, it has been widely accepted that the LCST behavior of PNIPAM is associated with the “hydrophobic
    interactions” of the hydrophobic backbone and isopropyl groups, [43–45] but this is a limited view. According to the microenvironmental
    polarity change indicated by TVPA probe, the PNIPAM network has completely transformed from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity
    under thermal stimulus (Figure 6a). By analyzing the molecular structure of PNIPAM, the amide groups present favorable
    interactions with water molecules through hydrogen bonds at low temperature and promote water solubility of PNIPAM chains.
    However, above the LCST, the coil-to-globule transition generates the collapsed PNIPAM domains with extensive intra- and
    inter-chain hydrogen bonds between amide groups, which will occupy the previous hydrogen-bond acceptors or donors for
    water and make the whole PNIPAM domains water insoluble. The dehydration of C=O and N−H groups and the formation of new
    hydrogen bonds between amide groups are further proved by the temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy measurements
    (Figure S20, Supporting Information). In this way, the PNIPAM domains are strengthened significantly due to the massive
    generation of noncovalent interactions, mainly including hydrogen bonds. Of course topological constraints implied by
    the distributions of network mesh-sizes and hydrophilic grafts make the morphology of the phase separation more complex.


    Under uniaxial mechanical stretching, the strengthened phase-separated hydrogels gradually break noncovalent interactions
    and dissipate the strain energy during the unraveling of the collapsed PNIPAM domains (Figure 6b). The orientation and
    alignment of polymer network with the reversible formation of new noncovalent interactions in highly stretched hydrogels,
    generate fiber-like structures and lead to an efficient resistance to crack propagation. Hence, the mechanical performance
    of the stimuli-responsive phase-separated hydrogels is improved just by heating when the macroscopic volume change is
    balanced by the swelling of PDMA domains. The role of fiber-like microphase separation is well demonstrated in tensile
    mode on pre-notched specimens. As shown in Figure 6c, the crack propagation along the horizontal direction is blocked
    when the crack tip meets a weak interface between PNIPAM and PDMA phases. Since the adhesive energy of PNIPAM/PDMA interfaces
    is incomparable to the cohesive energy, the crack deflects along the vertical stretching direction. Meanwhile, the concentrated
    tensile stress activates the chain orientation and alignment around the initial crack tip where strain amplification takes
    place. In contrast, the weaker areas at the edges of the hydrogel are cracked into additional notches, probably in the
    PDMA-rich swollen phase. In other words, the heterogeneous distribution of dense polymer-rich domains and weak highly
    hydrated phases promotes the formation of tearing-like crack multifurcation phenomenon, which efficiently enlarges the
    mechanical strain energy required to propagate the crack across the sample. Furthermore, the composition-dependence of
    the crack multifurcation is related to the thickness and the interface to volume ratio of fibrillar structures, which
    is predictable from their microphase separation patterns. Briefly, the above-mentioned mechanical behaviors of sacrificing
    the noncovalent interactions or weak interfaces between two separated phases in order to retard the fracture failure and
    preserve the integrity of the whole exactly match the proposed concept of morphomechanics.'

  content: 'In summary, we have successfully realized the direct visualization at mesoscale level of microphase separation
    with easy differentiation of hydrophobic collapsed PNIPAM domains in gels by developing a fluorescent indicator with both
    AIE and TICT characters that can be easily integrated into the PNIPAM network by polymerization in aqueous medium. The
    presence of hydrophilic macromonomer grafts in the network prevents the macroscopic collapse of the hydrogel and helps
    the generation of hierarchical fibrillary structures. The microphase separation can be readily identified at the mesoscale
    as spherical domains with different interconnected modes in a facile, high-contrast, and noninvasive manner. These observations
    under fluorescence microscopy revealed dense and hydrophobic mesostructures which had never been observed so far.


    The overall mechanism study has been well summarized by the proposed concept of morphomechanics. In contrast to the general
    understanding of “hydrophobic interactions,” the transformation from molecular hydrophilicity to morphological hydrophobicity
    has been attributed to the formation of multiple non-covalent interactions. The universality of these transformations
    by several stimuli-responsive sol-gel transitions, such concept could meet interests on materials science and biology
    communities. The crack multifurcation has been associated the fibrillary structures by direct observation of microphase
    separation patterns, which provides an additional energy dissipation pathway and enhances fracture energy. The mesoscopic
    exploration of stimuli-responsive materials remains a key-point to the design of high-strength gels or more biomimetic
    materials. For instance, for a better understanding of how biopolymers regulate their inter and intra assemblies via phase
    transition to perform various biological functions such as reaction acceleration, signal transduction, and transcriptional
    regulation. [46]'
