  content: The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in triple-negative breast cancer could hinder the response to thorough
    immunotherapy and diminish the antitumor efficacy. Although the STING pathway emerges as a promising target to remedy
    defects, uncertain drug delivery might lead to off-target inflammatory reactions. Here, we manifest a novel phototheranostic
    agent with an aggregation-induced emission property that guided the pharmacological activation of a STING agonist for
    photothermal immunotherapy to create an immunologically “hot” tumor. A pyridinium rotor strategy is proposed to develop
    a positively charged TBTP-Bz, which is stably coincorporated with a STING agonist MSA-2 into thermal-responsive exosome-liposome
    hybrid nanoparticles for tumor-targeting delivery. TBTP-Bz exhibits aggregation-enhanced NIR-II emission and a photoacoustic
    signal, accomplishing real-time tumor tracking. Its photothermal stimulation induces immunogenic cancer cell death and
    promotes the precise release of MSA-2, thus boosting STING activation and STING-mediated type I interferon production.
    Significantly, single-dose photoimmunotherapy effectively suppresses abscopal tumor growth and provokes an immune memory
    effect to inhibit postsurgical recurrent and rechallenged tumors. This demonstrates promising clinical potential for poorly
    immunogenic breast cancer.

  content: 'Despite continuing improvement in clinical treatment modalities including radiotherapy,1 chemotherapy,2,3 and
    surgery4 to initially eliminate most breast cancers, patients with aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer
    (TNBC) often experience high rates of recurrence and metastasis, posing a challenging issue of cancer-induced mortality.5
    In recent years, cancer immunotherapy utilizing drugs to activate the endogenous immune system, such as inducing immunogenic
    cancer cell death (ICD) to elicit antitumor effect, has demonstrated outstanding clinical efficacy and sustained therapeutic
    outcomes across various cancer types.6−10


    However, TNBC could orchestrate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to immune evasion and weak
    therapeutic response.11−13 Currently, immunotherapy for immunologically cold tumors has been challenging. Therefore, the
    key lies in selectively stimulating the immune system while effectively preventing immune escape.14 The stimulator of
    interferon genes (STING) is an intracellular signaling receptor that emerges as a critical pathway for governing the innate
    antitumor immune response.15 STING pathway activation can induce type I interferon (IFN) secretion and proinflammatory
    cytokine expression to remodel the immunosuppressed TME.16−19 It has been documented that triggering STING in cancer cells
    and specific immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) can enhance the ability of DC to cross-present antigens to CD8+
    T cells, which induces spontaneous tumor-specific T cell production and boosts antitumor effects.20,21 However, the majority
    of developed cyclic dinucleotide-based drugs require intratumoral injection, limiting their efficacy and potentially leading
    to uncontrolled systemic spread and widespread inflammatory reactions.22,23 MSA-2 is a newly developed non-nucleotide
    STING agonist.24 While this agent has been administered orally and intravenously in animal studies, its low bioavailability
    and insufficient cytosolic entry may constrain its antitumor effectiveness. Furthermore, reports suggest that excessive
    STING activation in immune cells may result in T cell death, promoting cancer cell survival and reinforcing an immunosuppressive
    environment.17,25,26 Therefore, precise and gentle stimulation of the STING pathway in targeted cells is crucial for this
    therapy.


    Photothermal therapy (PTT), which sensitizes and kills cancer cells by heat, has demonstrated the ability to activate
    inflammation and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, garnering significant attention.27−31 Organic fluorophore-based
    photothermal agents have been extensively developed due to their promise for imaging-guided therapies. Yet, the planar
    structures of traditional fluorescent materials often result in π−π stacking conformation and insufficient electron transition
    in physiological environments, significantly compromising their luminescence and photothermal conversion efficiency.32,33
    Of note, the photothermal agent with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties and intense fluorescence in the second
    near-infrared region (NIR-II, 1000−1700 nm), as an advanced conceptual visual theranostic platform, can effectively avoid
    molecular stacking by incorporating molecules with rotors and twisted structures.34−36 Controlled molecular rotation in
    their aggregated state enables the precise regulation of fluorescent intensity and photothermal efficiency.


    Based on the above-mentioned considerations, we aim to design highly efficient AIE phototheranostic agents that could
    enhance STING activation through molecular modulation. We innovatively propose a pyridinium rotor strategy, where the
    optimized molecular rotor is the N-substituent group of the pyridinium structure. This strategy can simultaneously enhance
    molecular rotation and intermolecular charge transfer, thus balancing the energy consumption pathway in the aggregated
    state. The optimized TBTP-Bz molecule exhibits efficient photothermal conversion efficiency and aggregation-enhanced NIR-II
    emission under 808 nm laser irradiation, enabling NIR-II fluorescence imaging (FLI)/photoacoustic imaging (PAI)/photothermal
    imaging (PTI)-guided PTT. At the same time, the precision of molecular targeting is crucial to ensure efficient local
    heat-induced cancer cell ablation while minimizing damage to normal tissues. Furthermore, enhancing the internalization
    efficiency of nanomaterials plays a significant role in promoting photothermal immunotherapy, which enhances STING activation
    and antigen presentation.37,38 In recent studies, researchers have utilized tumor-derived exosomes to encapsulate or fuse
    with nanomaterials, increasing the tumor-targeting ability and cellular internalization rate of nanomedicine through surface
    topological modifications.39−41


    Inspired by the intelligent process, a thermoresponsive biomimetic nanoparticle is fabricated for precise drug delivery
    and selectively leveraging innate antitumor immunity under NIR laser stimulation. Specifically, we fused the temperature-sensitive
    liposomal 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (DPPC) and 4T1 cancer cell-derived exosomes that entrap TBTP-Bz
    and MSA-2, forming what is termed AMFL. Upon accumulation and infiltration into the tumor region facilitated by abundant
    tumor receptors on the exosome surface, the AIE phototheranostic agent exhibits intense NIR-II fluorescence, photoacoustic
    and photothermal signals with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling real-time tracking of the tumor site in the three modalities.
    The photothermal effect based on the AIE phototheranostic agent promotes the deformation of DPPC, leading to a controlled
    release of MSA-2 for enhancing STING pathway activation in cancer cells. Additionally, the ICD induced by the AIE phototheranostic
    agent effectively triggers the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, demonstrating a synergistic enhancement
    with STING agonists, involving downstream immunostimulatory signal production and IFN secretion. Further investigation
    reveals that the STING signaling in DCs was cooperatively activated to elicit DC maturation and anticancer T cell priming
    for robust adaptive immune responses. Consequently, TNBC suppression, potent inhibition of distant tumors, and effective
    resistance to postsurgical recurrent and rechallenged tumors are clearly demonstrated in mice models. Hence, this study
    highlights the potential of AIE-based PTT augmenting STING agonist activation for the synergistic photothermal immunotherapy
    of TNBC.'

  content: 'A series of molecules with D−π−A-type structures were designed consisting of three compositions: the methoxy triphenylamine
    and pyridine moiety served as the electron donor (D) and the electron acceptor (A), respectively. A low-bandgap benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole)
    acceptor and a π-conjugated thiophene ring with bulky alkyl chains were strategically integrated as the extended π-bridge
    and intermolecular spacer. This design aimed to fortify the D−A interaction and facilitate intramolecular charge transfer,
    thereby reducing the electronic bandgap and extending the wavelengths of absorption and emission. In addition, the twisted
    conformation of triphenylamine and the incorporated alkyl chains effectively deter intermolecular π−π stacking, fostering
    a pronounced AIE effect and heightened fluorescence in the aggregate state. A benzyl group was added as a N-substituent
    of the pyridinium moiety, creating an additional intermolecular space and enhancing intramolecular motion. Consequently,
    TBTP-Bz with positive charges was synthesized. TBTP and TBTP-COOH were synthesized as controls (Figure 2a). All of the
    molecules were synthesized in good yields, ranging from 75 to 86% (Scheme S1), and their structures were fully characterized
    by NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopies (Figures S1−S6).


    The optical properties of TBTP, TBTP-Bz, and TBTP-COOH were investigated. The absorption spectrum of the molecules peaked
    at 805−835 nm in the aggregate state (Figure S7). The photoluminescence (PL) signals were detected within the 900−950
    nm range, with a broad band spanning the NIR-II region 1000−1550 nm. With NIR-I absorption and NIR-II fluorescence, these
    molecules proved ideal for deep tissue imaging with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The AIE characteristics of TBTP, TBTP-Bz,
    and TBTP-COOH were validated in different good/poor solvent mixtures. As depicted, TBTP, TBTP-Bz, and TBTP-COOH exhibited
    weak emissions in THF or DMF, yet showed intensified PL signals in 90 or 99% of the poor solvent conditions (Figure S8).
    To preliminarily assess their photothermal potential in physiological settings, an 808 nm laser was leveraged to align
    with their absorption peaks with enhanced tissue penetration depth. Experiments demonstrated that TBTP-Bz could attain
    temperatures of up to 72.9 °C after 6 min of laser irradiation with a concentration-dependent and laser power-dependent
    effect (Figure S9a−c). Notably, TBTP-Bz exhibited the highest photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 58.5% among
    the three AIE molecules (Figure S9). Furthermore, the photothermal stability and resistance to photobleaching of TBTP-Bz
    aggregates were confirmed through consistent temperature maintenance over three cycles of on−off heating.


    The high photothermal conversion efficiency of TBTP-Bz in its aggregate state prompted further investigation into its
    underlying mechanisms using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the GROMACS 2020 package. To obtain amorphous aggregates
    of the AIE molecules in physiological environments, 40 molecules were randomly placed in a cubic box for initial aggregation
    and then mixed with surrounding water molecules (Figure S10a−c). Energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm
    was performed to relax the system. The optimized snapshots of aggregates (Figure 2b) were picked from the production simulation
    to show the packing manner of the AIE molecules in the aggregate state, and the innermost molecules were chosen to study
    the stacking mode. TBTP-Bz exhibited the weakest intermolecular interaction (−534.79 kJ/mol) compared to the others (−592.93
    and −589.45 kJ/mol). Among all kinds of interactions, TBTP-Bz has a weak electrostatic interaction that could be attributed
    to the electronic repulsion of the positively charged pyridinium moiety. In comparison, the −COOH group in TBTP-COOH counteracts
    some of the repulsion effects from the positively charged group, showing a smaller intermolecular space and larger van
    der Waals interactions. Figure S10d−f depicts that TBTP-Bz exhibited a loose packing as it shows a smaller atomic contact
    ratio (84.9%) compared to the other molecules (92.0% for TBTP and 87.3% for TBTP-COOH). Similarly, the optimized ground-state
    and excited-state geometries of TBTP-Bz calculated by the density functional theory method showed an obvious dipole electrostatic
    distribution (Figure S11a−c). TBTP-Bz displayed the highest zeta potential (62.0 mV) among three molecules from dynamic
    light scattering (DLS) (Figure S12), testifying to the results from MD that the positively charged moiety of TBTP-Bz plays
    an important role in its packing mode.


    Next, the single-molecule and aggregated reorganization energies (λ), a quantitative analytical parameter of intrinsic
    geometry change upon photoexcitation representing the contribution of intramolecular motion, were calculated to evaluate
    the energy consumption from the excited state to the ground state through nonradiative pathways (Figure S11). TBTP-Bz
    single molecules and aggregates showed large total λ values of 12,922 and 4152 cm−1, respectively, with a high contribution
    of dihedral angle associated with molecular motions (81.6% for the gas phase and 62.3% for the aggregate state). The results
    from the calculation were in accordance with the strong photothermal conversion efficiency of TBTP-Bz from the experimental
    results. The nonradiative decay of the excited state of TBTP-Bz can be triggered by the drastic molecular motion of the
    large-sized and the electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged pyridinium moiety, whereas these interactions could
    significantly loose the molecular packing and promote the balance of the radiative and nonradiative decay.'

  content: 'To ensure drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic effect, nanoparticles with balanced tumor-targeting specificity,
    stimulus-responsive function, and biological barrier penetration ability are desirable. Herein, an exosome-liposome fusion
    strategy was used to encapsulate TBTP-Bz and MSA-2, obtaining AMFL. The exosome−liposome hybrid nanoparticles (FL) were
    fabricated via the thin-film hydration method. The absorption and FTIR spectrum of AMFL exhibited characteristic peaks
    corresponding to TBTP-Bz and MSA-2, confirming the successful loading of both molecules (Figures 3a and S13). Western
    blot (WB) analysis revealed the presence of CD9 and CD63 proteins in AMFL and exosome membranes (Figure S14). Since CD9
    and CD63 are characteristic surface proteins found on 4T1 cell-derived exosomes, their expression in AMFL indicates the
    successful integration of exosome membrane components, imparting it with tumor-targeting capability. DLS measurements
    demonstrated that the size and zeta potential of AMFL remained consistent with those of liposomes, ensuring the stability
    of the hybrid nanoparticles (Figures 3b,c and S15). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of AMFL revealed spherical
    vesicles with a diameter of ∼80 nm (Figures 3d and S16).


    Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of DPPC and DPPC-exosome fusion nanoparticles exhibited a distinct phase
    transition process with a similar transition temperature of ∼41 °C, indicative of a cooperative and reversible thermal-responsive
    gel-to-fluid transition. Subsequently, the photothermal properties of AMFL and its capability for controlled drug release
    were evaluated (Figures 3e−h and S17). Upon exposure to 808 nm laser irradiation, AMFL nanoparticles in TEM images showed
    an expanded and disintegrated morphology, which could be attributed to the thermal-responsive nature of the liposomal
    component under the photothermal effects of TBTP-Bz. In addition, the efficient release of MSA-2 was realized under the
    photothermal effect of AMFL. Furthermore, confocal microscopy images demonstrated that AMFL exhibited enhanced internalization
    by cancer cells compared to AML, which contained only liposomes as encapsulated materials, underscoring its potent cancer
    cell penetration ability (Figure S18).'

  content: 'Leveraging the tumor-targeting capabilities and photothermal-responsive drug release functionality, the anticancer
    efficacy was assessed. First, preliminary studies were performed to ensure the therapeutic potential of TBTP-Bz over those
    of the other two molecules. The FL encapsulating TBTP-Bz was designated as AFL, and the FL encapsulating TBTP and TBTP-COOH
    were designated as AFLa and AFLc, respectively. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) cell viability assay and thermal imaging
    recording demonstrated that TBTP-Bz has the highest phototoxicity and in vivo photothermal effect in tumor-bearing mice
    (Figures S19 and S20).


    Next, the in vitro efficacy of AMFL was evaluated. AFL and the pure liposomes encapsulating both TBTP-Bz and MSA-2 were
    designated as AML, as control groups. The CCK-8 cell viability assay demonstrated that AMFL exhibited negligible cytotoxicity
    toward 4T1 cells, consistent with prior findings that MSA-2 does not induce direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells.
    AML displayed moderate cytotoxicity under laser irradiation, with a cell viability of 44.1% ± 4.4% even at high concentrations
    of TBTP-Bz and MSA-2, possibly due to its inadequate cancer cell internalization. Under NIR laser irradiation, AMFL and
    AFL exhibited significantly enhanced cytotoxicity by killing over 90% of the 4T1 cancer cells, showcasing the photothermal
    properties of TBTP-Bz and efficient cellular delivery with FL encapsulation (Figures 4a and S21).


    Subsequently, flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the cell apoptosis ratio by annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The proportion
    of apoptotic cells surged to 36.1% in the AMFL-treated groups following laser irradiation, surpassing the control groups
    and signifying the onset of proapoptotic processes. To elucidate the mechanism behind the AMFL-mediated superior antitumor
    efficacy, PTT-induced ICD, DC maturation, and relevant immune markers were investigated. The typical characteristics of
    ICD, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release, calreticulin (CRT) translocation to the cell surface, and high mobility
    group box 1 protein (HMGB1) expression, were first examined. These features facilitate antigen uptake, processing, and
    presentation by DCs, promoting cytotoxic T cell production. As shown in the immunofluorescence staining images, intense
    fluorescence signals of HMGB1 and CRT were detected in the AFL and AMFL-treated groups under NIR laser irradiation. The
    level of ATP in the tumors of the AMFL + NIR group exhibited a 5.7-fold increase compared to PBS-treated controls, indicative
    of ICD induction.


    After verifying the ICD-evoking ability of AMFL, DC maturation was investigated. We treated 4T1 breast cancer cells in
    different groups and then indirectly cocultured with murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) via a Transwell
    system that allows the transfer of hybrid nanoparticles to the BMDC. The populations of matured DCs increased to 36.1
    and 56.0% for AFL + NIR and AMFL + NIR groups, respectively. In contrast, no significant changes in matured DC populations
    (17.7%) were noted in the AMFL group in the absence of laser irradiation, indicating the limited impact of AMFL on inducing
    DC maturation without an effective drug release. While ICD induction has been reported to be a potentially promising pathway
    for immunotherapy, immune escape poses a challenge to its efficacy. To address this, MSA-2 in AMFL serves as the STING-pathway
    activator to boost the antitumor immune response.


    To further explore whether AMFL could activate the STING pathway in cancer cells, the related signaling pathway was analyzed.
    WB analysis confirmed heightened levels of phosphorylated STING, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and interferon regulatory
    factor 3 in AMFL and AMFL + NIR groups compared to control groups that lack MSA-2 (AFL + NIR group), indicating STING
    pathway activation. Notably, the STING pathways were stimulated in DCs. We extracted the supernatant of AMFL-treated 4T1
    tumor cells post low-speed centrifugation and used it for BMDC conditioning. WB results exhibited elevated expression
    levels of key STING signaling components following AMFL treatment, notably higher than the other groups. On the other
    hand, the efficient DC uptake of AMFL was testified, providing the support that MSA-2 could deliver to DC for STING activation.
    Additionally, the STING signaling components in the AMFL + NIR group promoted IFN-β and TNF-α production in 4T1 cells
    and DCs, along with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-6. This underscores AMFL’s ability to dual-stimulate
    ICD and STING pathways, thus enhancing DC maturation and its antigen-presenting power.'

  content: 'To further validate the suitability of AMFL for in vivo theranostics and investigate its potential for clinical
    application, we assessed the tumor-targeting capability in 4T1-bearing mice using multimodal imaging techniques. Initially,
    AMFL solution was imaged to show concentration-dependent NIR-II signals under 808 nm laser excitation (Figure S24). Then
    it was intravenously administered to the tumor-bearing mice, and tumor accumulation was monitored through NIR-II FLI.
    As a control, AML that utilizes pure liposomes as encapsulating materials was also injected under the same conditions.
    The tumor structure was imaged with 1250 nm bypass at different time points. A clear resolution of tumor features was
    observed with gradually increased NIR-II fluorescence intensity in the AMFL groups. The intensity reached the platform
    at 12 h post injection and remained steady even at 24 h post injection, indicating its long-term retention potential.
    Longer imaging wavelengths enhanced the spatial resolution of fine structures of the tumor area by remarkably increasing
    the signal-to-noise ratio. In comparison, mice treated with AML displayed a much weaker NIR-II fluorescence signal in
    tumor regions, indicating the effective tumor accumulation of AMFL. Furthermore, in vivo biodistribution also showed similar
    results that AMFL possessed higher tumor accumulation and retentions.


    Additionally, we intravenously injected AMFL into a mouse’s bloodstream, and its angiography was recorded. The whole vessel
    network of the mouse is clearly visualized in prone positions, providing more accurate diagnostic information about early
    diseases. Next, the in vivo PTT potential of AMFL was investigated. After intravenous injection of AMFL for 12 h, the
    tumor temperatures of the mice were monitored over time using IR thermography while being exposed to 808 nm laser irradiation.
    The obvious temperature rise in AMFL-treated mice with a maximum temperature of 50.6 °C upon irradiation (0.5 W/cm2) for
    5 min, while mice receiving PBS showed negligible temperature elevation in the same condition. Inspired by the promising
    photothermal effect, the application of AMFL in PA imaging was studied. The direct correlation observed between the PA
    intensity and the concentration of the AMFL underscores the significant potential in facilitating quantitative PA imaging.
    In vivo PA tumor imaging was conducted by intravenous injection of AMFL into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Intense PA signal
    was distinctly visible at the tumor site at 4 h post injection and reached its peak around 12 h post injection, mirroring
    the results obtained from NIR-II imaging.'

  content: 'Posteriorly, we further used a bilateral tumor mouse model to investigate the in vivo therapy potential of AMFL
    as a photothermal-immunotherapeutic trigger. The bilateral tumor model was established by injection of 4T1 cells into
    the right and left flanks as the primary tumor and distant tumor on day 0, respectively. Mice were randomly assigned to
    five groups when the primary tumor reached ∼200 mm3: PBS + NIR, FL (unloaded exosome−liposome hybrid nanoparticles), AML
    + NIR, AFL + NIR, AMFL, and AMFL + NIR. The formulations were intravenously injected, and the primary tumor was directly
    irradiated (808 nm, 0.5 W/cm2, 5 min) at 12 h post injection. The evaluation results of the tumors demonstrated that the
    AMFL + NIR treatment exhibited effective suppression of primary tumors and growth control of distant tumors with the highest
    survival rate. The body weight of the mice in each group did not change significantly after administration. Histological
    examination of tumor slices stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed the efficient destruction of tumor cells in both
    primary and distant tumors, indicating an abscopal effect of AMFL.


    Furthermore, the immunofluorescence analysis of primary tumor slices showed that the mice in AMFL and AMFL + NIR groups
    have a high expression on p-TBK1 and p-IRF3, indicating the STING activation due to the precise accumulation of MSA-2
    on tumors. Meanwhile, the secretion of STING-related cytokines such as IFN-β, as well as proinflammatory cytokines involving
    IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6, were measured by ELISA and RT-qPCR, showing a substantial increase in tumor tissues of the AMFL
    + NIR group compared to the other groups, supporting the STING pathway activation and the potential to convert the “cold”
    tumor into a more sensitive “hot” tumor. It is worth noting that the intravenously injected pure MSA-2 drug in mice caused
    significantly higher secretion levels of TNF-α and IFN-β compared to the same concentration of MSA-2 in AMFL, which may
    lead to unwanted systemic immunity. This indicates the importance of the precise drug release of AMFL.


    Encouraged by the in vivo therapeutic effect and STING activation, the elevation of systemic immunity was evaluated. The
    expression of mature DCs (CD80+ CD86+) in the lymph nodes and spleen was enhanced by ∼2.6- and 2-fold after AMFL + NIR
    treatment in contrast with the PBS + NIR groups, along with CD8+ T cell activation in the lymph nodes. The frequency of
    tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells exhibited a remarkable rise in distant tumor tissues in the AMFL + NIR groups, confirming
    the induction of a robust immune response. Thus, the mechanism of the abscopal effect can be revealed. Benefiting from
    the efficient tumor-targeting ability and accumulation effects facilitated by the exosome-liposome hybrid encapsulation,
    the PTT effect was presented by TBTP-Bz under NIR laser irradiation. This process assisted the infiltration of MSA-2 and
    the induction of the STING pathway with cytokine secretion. The synergistic therapeutic effect may contribute to DC maturation
    and subsequent T cell activation in tumor tissues, thereby eliciting an antitumor immune response.


    To fully exploit the long-term protection effect of our photothermal-immunotherapeutic trigger and assess its clinical
    potential, we established a recurrent and rechallenged tumor model in mice. Following the treatments mentioned earlier,
    the primary tumor in the right hind leg of the mice was surgically removed on day 4 and the mice were subsequently rechallenged
    with secondary 4T1 tumors in the left hind leg. The volumes of the recurrent and rechallenged 4T1 tumors were monitored
    at certain time intervals. Assessment of tumor volume and weight revealed that AMFL + NIR treatment effectively suppressed
    the malignant growth of both recurrent and rechallenged tumors compared to the other groups, accompanied by an increased
    secretion of pro-proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, ultimately leading to improved survival rates among
    tumor-bearing mice.


    To evaluate the long-term antitumor immune responses, we examined the frequency of central memory T cells (TCM, CD62L+
    CD44+) collected from mice treated with different regimens. The frequency of TCM cells significantly rose in the AMFL
    + NIR group, with the proportion of TCM cells being approximately 2-fold higher than that in the control groups. This
    suggests that the functional TCM generated by the AMFL + NIR treatment could provide substantial long-term protection
    against tumor recurrence and rechallenge. In addition, the TUNEL and H&E staining of tumor slices revealed extensive cell
    damage in the post-treatment period, with the most severe damage observed in the AMFL + NIR group. In contrast, the other
    five control treatment groups exhibited only partial cell damage in their respective tumor slices.


    Following the treatments, the body weights of mice across all groups remained stable for 21 days, and no significant morphological
    changes were observed in the main organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney). Blood biochemical analysis revealed
    excellent blood compatibility and the least liver toxicity, with no discernible differences between the groups, indicating
    that the formulated AMFL exhibited minimal systemic toxicity during the treatment period. These findings underscore the
    favorable in vivo biosafety profile of AMFL for cancer immunotherapy.'

  content: 'To this end, we have first proposed a pyridinium rotor strategy to develop simple D−A-type AIE phototheranostic
    agents. By functionalizing the N-substituents of pyridinium, the increased molecular rotor in the molecules helps with
    skeleton distortion and twisting. The resulting drastic intramolecular motions of optimized molecules TBTP-Bz will dissipate
    parts of the excited-state energy via nonradiative decay, leading to an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of
    58.5%. More importantly, TBTP-Bz exhibits aggregation-induced NIR-II fluorescence for highly sensitive NIR-II FLI-guided
    multimodal tumor diagnosis and efficient phototherapy, which is suitable for potentiating following cancer immunotherapy.


    Here, we constructed thermosensitive cancer-targeting AMFL by coating 4T1 TNBC cell exosome membranes and temperature-responsive
    liposomal DPPC encapsulated with TBTP-Bz and MSA-2. Equipped with specific receptors for 4T1 tumor, intravenously injected
    AMFL imaged the tumor area via long-retention NIR-II fluorescent emission and photothermal energy-derived PA signal. Upon
    the tumor-killing photothermal effect generated by TBTP-Bz under 808 nm laser irradiation, the temperature elevation facilitates
    the deformation of the AMFL and in situ drug release, substantially improving favorable delivery efficiencies of MSA-2
    and its STING-stimulating activity on both cancer cell and DCs, thus triggering immune responses to switch the immunologically
    “cold” tumor to a more sensitive “hot” one. The synergistic photothermal-immunotherapeutic effect was verified through
    enhanced tumor regression, effective distant tumor suppression, and significant inhibition of postsurgical tumor recurrence
    and rechallenge.


    In summary, this thermoresponsive biomimicking nanomedicine operates precise PTT with real-time NIR-II imaging modality,
    which potentiates antitumor immune response by STING pathway activation for poorly immunogenic tumor treatment.'
