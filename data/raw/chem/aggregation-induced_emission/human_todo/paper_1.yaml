  content: Polyelectrolytes play an important role in both natural biological systems and human society, and their synthesis,
    functional exploration, and profound application are thus essential for biomimicry and creating new materials. In this
    study, we developed an efficient synthetic methodology for in situ generation of azonia-containing polyelectrolytes in
    a one-pot manner by using readily accessible nonionic reactant in the presence of commercially available cheap ionic species.
    The resulting polyelectrolytes are emissive in the solid state and can readily form luminescent photopatterns with different
    colors. The azonia-containing polyelectrolytes possess extraordinary potency of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
    enabling them to impressively kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a drug resistant superbug, both
    in vitro and in vivo.

    1−3 Polyelectrolytes are ionizable polymers possessing the combined behaviors of polymers and electrolytes, which can
    drastically change the fluid properties of aqueous solutions and interact with oppositely charged macromolecules, small
    ions, and even neutral particles. Polyelectrolytes have demonstrated great potency in many aspects, for example, thickening
    agents in food industry, wastewater treatment in environment science, and diagnostic and therapeutic agents in medicine.
    4,5 For biomimicry and creating new materials, it is attractive to synthesize and study polyelectrolytes. However, the
    progress is unsatisfactory because of their synthetic difficulty.6 The main methodology for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes
    is post-modification of nonionic polymers. 7−9 One archetype example is sodium polystyrenesulfonate (NaPSS), which is
    synthesized by adding sulfonate groups after polymerization. 10,11 Another typical example is poly(acrylic acid) (PAA),
    which is generally obtained by the hydrolysis of polyacrylate. 12,13 Theoretically, the postmodifications are hard to
    be 100% completed, allowing patches along the polymer chain, which are impossible to be removed and purified. Some coupling
    reactions (Heck 14 and Sonogashira 15) are also employed for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes, but they frequently require
    expensive and limited types of ionic monomers.


    Most commercially available polyelectrolytes (such as NaPSS and PAA) are commodity polymers, which are cheap and useful
    in daily life but show no advanced functional properties. 16,17 Specialty polymers (such as conducting polymers, liquid
    crystalline polymers, and biomedical polymers) are attracting much interest because of their novel functionalities. 18−23
    There has been some progress in developing specialty polyelectrolytes, with water-soluble conjugated polymers being a
    typical example. Plenty of water-soluble conjugated polymers have been designed and synthesized for bioimaging, diagnosis,
    and therapy, 24−28 using their fluorescence and photodynamic properties. However, traditional specialty polymers often
    suffer from the aggregation-caused quenching effect in the condensed state, which significantly decreases their emission
    efficiency or intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency because of the high probability of the excited state to undergo nonradiative
    relaxation. 29 As it is hard to completely avoid aggregation in diverse practical applications, new specialty polyelectrolytes
    are in great demand to address these problems. 30


    In our previous work, some azonia aromatic compounds have been found to show aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics
    with strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability. 31−34 The azonia rings are highly electron-deficient, and
    it is thus easy to form donor−acceptor (D−A) structures with tunable emission color by combining with different electron
    donors. 35 Many reported antibiotics are also azonia-containing molecules, but the processability of these small molecules
    is quite limited. 36 Thus, we intend to combine the excellent performance of azonia aromatic compounds with processable
    polymers to create new functional materials with expectable optical properties and processability. The resulting azonia-containing
    polyelectrolytes are expected to show good processing ability that can be easily fabricated into luminescent films for
    applications in surface modification, patterning, and large area display systems. With high charge density in the polymer
    chain, the azonia-containing polyelectrolytes may show affinity to negative charge species (such as bacteria membrane
    and DNA), which enables them to wrap the surface of bacteria and physically kill them. 4,37,38 By introducing D−A structure
    into the polyelectrolytes, the nonradiative decay channel is blocked due to the rigid structure, 29 which is beneficial
    for bioimaging and ROS generation. As a result, the azonia-containing polyelectrolytes are potential powerful weapons
    to kill superbugs by photodynamic therapy besides physically killing. 39,40


    Owing to the attractive properties of azonia aromatic compounds, many novel approaches have been developed for the synthesis
    of azonia small molecules, 41 including ring-closing metathesis reactions, 42,43 annulation reactions based on C−H activation,
    44−46 and so on. However, it is challenging to develop these small molecule reactions for polymer synthesis due to the
    limited organic reactions with mild reaction conditions, broad monomer scope, and high efficiency. In 2017, Jun et al.
    reported an efficient method for the synthesis of benzoquinolizinium salts in a one-pot manner from simple starting materials
    (Scheme 1A). 47 Inspired by this work, we try to develop such an efficient small molecule reaction into a useful tool
    for the synthesis of azonia-containing polyelectrolytes.


    In this study, we developed a synthetic methodology by readily accessible nonionic reactant in the presence of commercially
    available cheap ionic species to in situ generate azonia-containing polyelectrolytes in a one-pot manner. The main-chain
    polyelectrolytes were generated in excellent yields (up to 99%) with high molecular weights (up to 28700 Da). The azonia-containing
    polyelectrolytes were luminescent in the solid state with good processing ability, which enabled them to be excellent
    candidate materials for fluorescent photopattern generation. With extraordinary strong ROS generation ability, these polyelectrolytes
    could impressively solve the bacterial resistance issue. Systematic antibacterial explorations were conducted, including
    bacteria staining and killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a drug resistant superbug in vitro and
    in vivo.'

  content: 'Monomers used in this work are easily available. Allylamines 1a and 1b, tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4, 3a), sodium
    hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6, 3b), sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3, 3c), sodium tetraphenylborate (NaBPh4, 3d),
    sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4), and hexafluorophosphoric acid (HPF6) were commercially available and used without further
    purification. The internal diynes 2a−h used in this work were readily synthesized without column chromatography purification.
    All of the polymerizations were catalyzed by [Cp*RhCl2]2 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O and conducted under an air atmosphere in a one-pot
    manner.


    To obtain soluble polyelectrolytes with high molecular weights in high yields, we systematically investigated the polymerization
    conditions using 1a, 2a, and 3a as monomers. The solvent, monomer ratio, catalyst loading, concentration, and reaction
    time were carefully investigated (Table 1). The effect of solvent on the polymerization was first investigated (entries
    1−5, Table 1). Polar solvents such as MeOH, DCM, MeOH/DMSO, and MeOH/DCM mixed solvents were investigated, and the best
    polymerization result was obtained in MeOH/DCM (v/v, 1/1), affording polymer with Mw of 19200 Da in 72% yield (entry 5,
    Table 1). It was found that the monomer ratio (entries 5 and 6, Table 1) exerted little effect on the polymerization,
    while the catalyst loading (entries 5 and 7−9, Table 1) played a crucial role in the polymerization. Decreasing the amount
    of [Cp*RhCl2]2 from 10 to 5 mol % even increased the Mw and yield (entry 7, Table 1), but further reducing the loading
    of [Cp*RhCl2]2 or Cu(OAc)2·H2O led to a sharp decrease in both the values of Mw and yield. With the optimized catalyst
    loading, we further investigated the effect of monomer concentration and reaction time on the polymerization. When the
    monomer concentration of 1a was decreased from 0.2 to 0.15 M, both the Mw and yield decreased sharply (entry 11, Table
    1). When the monomer concentration of 1a was improved from 0.2 to 0.25 M, the Mw and yield decreased slightly, with partial
    gelation occurring (entry 10, Table 1). A time of 24 h was adopted as the optimal reaction time, as a further decrease
    of the reaction time led to unsatisfactory values of Mw and yield (entries 12 and 13, Table 1).


    With the optimized polymerization conditions in hand, different monomer combinations were applied to test the robustness
    and wide applicability of this polymerization route (Table 2). Monomers 2a−c were internal diynes with a flexible alkyl
    chain or oxyalkyl chain as a spacer, while 2d−f were rigid conjugated diynes with different electron densities. Monomers
    3a−d were abundant and cheap acid or salt. Diynes 2a−f all reacted efficiently with 1a and 3a, affording polyelectrolytes
    with high yield and molecular weight (entries 1−6, Table 2). The diarylacetylene structure was crucial for this polymerization,
    as only a trace amount of product was obtained when tert-butyl-substituted diyne 2g (Scheme S1) was used as a diyne monomer
    to react with 1a and 3a. The fluorene-substituted diyne 2h (Scheme S1) also failed to be polymerized effectively, probably
    due to the large steric hindrance of the fluorene moiety. Regarding the monomer scope of allylamines, both unsubstituted
    allylamine 1a or methyl-substituted allylamine 1b could react efficiently with diyne 2a or 2e in the presence of 3a (entries
    1, 2, 7, and 8, Table 2). However, 1b was less reactive compared to 1a, which was probably due to the steric hindrance
    of the methyl group. Finally, we further explored the influence of ion source on the polymerization process. On the basis
    of the mechanism of small molecules, 47 we proposed a mechanism of the polymerization route (Scheme S3). In the proposed
    mechanism, the ion source could react with the seven-membered rhodacycle complex D to form benzoquinolizium salt, which
    was crucial to the polymerization. We had demonstrated that HBF4 3a, NaPF6 3b, and NaCF3SO3 3c could react efficiently
    with 1a and 2a to generate polyelectrolytes with moderate Mw and yield (entries 1, 9, and 10, Table 2), while the NaBPh4
    3d was much less reactive with 1a and 2a (entry 11, Table 2), presumably resulting from the steric hindrance. HPF6 failed
    to polymerize with 1a and 2a, probably due to the too strong acidity or decomposition upon heating of HPF6. These results
    indicated that we successfully developed an efficient and powerful polymerization tool for the construction of azonia-containing
    polyelectrolytes. The only byproduct produced from this polymerization was hydrogen ion, indicating its high atom economy.


    Most of the obtained polyelectrolytes showed good solubility in commonly used organic solvents, such as DCM, chloroform,
    DMSO, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), whereas P1b/2a/3a and P1a/2a/3c were partially insoluble in these solvents. The
    thermal properties of the polyelectrolytes were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the results indicated
    that the 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) were in the range 218−323 °C (Figure S4), suggesting that they were thermally
    stable. Additionally, P1a/2d/3a and P1a/2e/3a displayed 70% of their weight even upon heating to 800 °C.'

  content: 'The structures of the resulting polymers were characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectra. To gain insight into the
    structures of these azonia-containing polyelectrolytes, model compound 2 was prepared by cascade double N-annulation reaction
    of allylamine 1a, diphenylacetylene 1, and HBF4 under the same synthetic conditions for the polyelectrolytes (Scheme S2).
    Typical FT-IR analysis and 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of polymer P1a/2a/3a, model compound 2, and their corresponding
    monomers 1a and 2a were performed accordingly for further illustration. In the FT-IR spectra (Figure S1), the N−H stretching
    vibration of 1a and the C≡C stretching vibrations of 2a occurred at 3012 and 2220 cm−1, respectively. These peaks could
    not be observed in the spectra of P1a/2a/3a and 2. Meanwhile, a new peak associated with B−F stretching vibrations appeared
    at 1083 cm−1, indicating the successful occurrence of the reaction. Similar results were obtained in the FT-IR spectra
    of other polymers (Figures S2 and S3).


    In addition, NMR spectra could provide more detailed information about the polymer structures. In the 1H NMR spectra,
    the protons at positions “a”, “b”, and “c” of 1a resonate at δ 5.95, 5.43, and 3.63 ppm, respectively, but disappeared
    in the 1H NMR spectra of P1a/2a/3a and 2. Most importantly, new peaks emerged at δ 8.84 and 8.37 ppm in the spectra of
    P1a/2a/3a and 2, corresponding to the aromatic protons from the newly formed benzoquinolizinium rings (Figure 1A−D). The
    13C NMR spectra further verified the polymer structure (Figure 1E−H). The characteristic peaks of C≡C in 2a were not observed
    in the polymer spectrum. Instead, the aromatic carbon on benzoquinolizinium rings resonated at δ 143−120 ppm in the spectra
    of P1a/2a/3a and 2. For all of the 11 polyelectrolytes, the characteristic peaks at δ 8.90−8.10 ppm all emerged in their
    1H NMR spectra and their characteristic C≡C peaks at δ 90.0−88.0 ppm all disappeared in their 13C NMR spectra, confirming
    successful fabrication of their azonia-containing polyelectrolytes accordingly (Figures S22−S48).'

  content: 'The absorption and emission spectra of dilute DCM solutions (10 μM) of the resulting azonia-containing polyelectrolytes
    were shown in Figures S6 and S7. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing azonia aromatic moiety, the maximum emission wavelength
    of these polymers was facilely tunable from 490 to 610 nm, which arised from the polymerization from diyne monomers with
    different electron densities.


    By incorporating TPE and TPA moieties into the polyelectrolyte skeletons, respectively, the resulting polymers P1a/2d/3a
    and P1a/2e/3a showed typical AIE features. Taking P1a/2d/3a as an example, its DCM solution emitted weakly at 574 nm.
    With the addition of hexane, a nonpolar poor solvent for the polymer, the emission intensity gradually increased. The
    photographs of these dispersions taken in DCM/hexane mixtures with different hexane fractions visually showed the trends
    in fluorescence (Figure 2A), and the maximum emission wavelengths slightly blue-shifted to 558 nm (Figure 2B). The PL
    intensity of P1a/2d/3a aggregates in DCM/hexane mixture with 99% hexane fraction (I99) was ∼13-fold higher than that in
    pure DCM solution (I0) (Figure 2C). A similar phenomenon was observed for P1a/2e/3a (Figure S9).


    After that, the solid fluorescence of these azonia-containing polyelectrolytes was examined (Figure 2D); all of these
    polymers were emissive in the solid state. P1a−b/2a−c/3a−b displayed yellow-green emission, P1a/2d/3a and P1b/2e/3a emitted
    orange fluorescence, and P1a/2e/3a exhibited red emission. PL spectra of these polymers in the solid state were further
    obtained (Figure 2E). Because of the excellent solubility and film-forming ability of P1/2/3, their uniform films could
    be easily fabricated without defect on silica wafers by a simple spin-coating technique.


    Macroscopically processable polymers with high refractive indices (RIs) are promising candidate materials for various
    photonic applications, including optical chips, prisms, optical waveguides, memories, and holographic image recording
    systems. 48 Since multifused heterocyclic rings were incorporated in the polymer main chain, the azonia-containing polyelectrolytes
    are expected to show a high refractive index. The thin films of P1/2/3 were prepared by spin-coating, and their refractive
    indexes were measured accordingly. As summarized in Figure S8 and Table S1, their thin films indeed showed high n values
    of 1.817−1.600 in the spectral region of 400−900 nm. Their n values at 632.8 nm (n632.8) were in the range 1.686−1.621,
    which were much higher than common polymers such as polystyrene, polycarbonate, poly(methyl methacrylate), and polyacrylate
    with n632.8 in the region of 1.49−1.58. 49


    The generation of fluorescent patterns by the photolithography technique is of great significance in terms of the photonic
    and electronic applications. 50−52 As shown in Figure 2F−I, after irradiation by UV light in air for 20 min through a
    copper photomask, the fluorescence of the exposed regions (lines) was completely quenched due to the photo-oxidation of
    the chromophores, while the emissive squares were protected by copper and remained intact. Thus, two-dimensional fluorescent
    patterns with different emissive colors were generated with high resolution and sharp edges. By changing the shape and
    scale of the photomask, various patterns in different scales could be generated, such as QR code, which could be used
    for information storage (Figure 2I). Herein, these azonia-containing polyelectrolytes were expected to be promising materials
    for pattern fabrication, which would have profound implications in constructing electronic and photonic devices and various
    hybrid devices as excellent luminescent photoresist materials in a cost-efficient photolithography process. The photostability
    result showed that these polyelectrolytes were stable under the exposure of normal room light (Figures S13 and S14) and
    were also able to undergo a photo-oxidative bleaching process with a tunable refractive index under the exposure of a
    strong UV light source (Figure S16, Table S3).'

  content: 'The unique azonia moiety in these polymers encouraged us to explore their ROS generation ability and application
    in bacteria killing. 53−55 H2DCF-DA is a commercial ROS indicator, which is nonfluorescent but emits green fluorescence
    when oxidized by ROS. 56 H2DCF-DA was utilized to investigate the ROS generation ability of these azonia-containing polyelectrolytes,
    and P1a/2e/3a, P1a/2d/3a, and P1a/2c/3a were chosen for demonstration. As shown in Figure S10, in the mixture of polyelectrolytes
    and H2DCF-DA, the fluorescence intensity of H2DCF-DA at 525 nm increased gradually with the extension of irradiation time.
    A steeper slope of curves indicated a much higher ROS generation rate, suggesting that three polyelectrolytes exhibited
    a different ROS generation efficiency in the order of P1a/2e/3a > P1a/2d/3a > P1a/2c/3a.


    Among all of the ROS species, such as superoxide (O2•−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and singlet
    oxygen (1O2), 1O2 is regarded as a primary cytotoxic agent. 57 Herein, 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)-dimalonic acid
    (ABDA), a specific probe to detect 1O2, was utilized to prove the generation of 1O2 from azonia-containing polyelectrolytes.
    58 In the presence of 1O2, ABDA is transformed into endoperoxide, leading to a decrease of ABDA absorption at 378 nm.
    The absorbance spectra of ABDA solution in the presence of P1a/2c/3a, P1a/2d/3a, and P1a/2e/3a were recorded upon white
    light irradiation (Figure 3A−C). In the presence of these polyelectrolytes, noticeable reduction of ABDA absorption was
    observed, especially for P1a/2e/3a, which caused the fastest drop of ABDA absorption (Figure 3D). For comparison, a commercial
    dye, Rose Bengal, which was widely used to generate 1O2 with a singlet oxygen quantum yield of 75%, was investigated under
    the same condition (Figures S11 and S12). The decomposition rates of ABDA in the presence of polyelectrolytes and Rose
    Bengal were calculated quantifi cationally (Figure 3D), and the results indicated that P1a/2e/3a was able to generate
    1O2 much more effectively than Rose Bengal. Such strong 1O2 generation ability of P1a/2e/3a was probably due to the extended
    conjugation length between donor and acceptor, which minimized the ΔEST and enhanced the possibility of the ISC process.
    Also, the strong D−A conjugated structure of P1a/2e/3a rigidified its polymer backbone, which could minimize its nonradiative
    decay and thus promote the ISC process. Notably, undetectable ROS generation of monomers 1a, 2e, and 3a was also proved
    by the chemical trapping measurements with ABDA as an indicator (Figure S17). The photostability study showed that P1a/2e/3a
    indicated better photostability than organic dyes RB and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphyrin (TPPS), two
    traditional photosensitizers generally employed for PDT (Figure S15).'

  content: 'The strong 1O2 generation ability of these polyelectrolytes motivated us to further explore its performance as
    a photosensitizer in bacteria inhibition. P1a/2e/3a with the most significant ROS generation was chosen for further biological
    evaluation. The hydrodynamic diameter of P1a/2e/3a micelles was determined to be ∼106 nm by dynamic laser scattering (DLS)
    analysis, and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed the spherical morphology and size (Figure
    4A). Then, in vitro antimicrobial activities of P1a/2e/3a were first evaluated toward representative Gram-positive S.
    aureus and Gram-negative E. coli, respectively (Figure S18). The polymer showed weak inhibition to E. coli even under
    light irradiation but strong inhibition to S. aureus under white light irradiation with a minimal inhibition concentration
    (MIC) of 15 μg/mL. The different antimicrobial ability was probably due to the membrane difference between Gram-negative
    bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria; it was difficult for polymer micelles to access the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria
    due to its extra protective membrane components. 39


    MRSA is one of the most notorious drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria in the hospital environment and community settings,
    leading to a variety of clinical syndromes such as endocarditis, pneumonia, and central nervous system infections. 59−61
    As the polyelectrolyte P1a/2e/3a showed good inhibition to Gram-positive S. aureus, the inhibition potency against MRSA
    was evaluated to further explore its antimicrobial ability against drug-resistant bacteria. As shown in Figure 4B, the
    high charge density in the polymer main chain enabled P1a/2e/3a to possess a high affinity to negatively charged bacteria
    membrane and thus could stain MRSA quickly, as short as 5 min. Furthermore, persistent fluorescence was found for bacteria
    even upon incubation for 60 min, which was favorable for extended light irradiation.


    After that, the quantitative MRSA inhibition of P1a/2e/3a was performed in the presence or absence of light irradiation
    (Figure 4C). In the dark state, P1a/2e/3a exhibited moderate inhibition against MRSA, as the positive charges on the polyelectrolyte
    main chain enabled the micelles to adhere and fuse with the bacteria membrane and thus physically damaged bacteria membrane
    to some extent. 62 Upon white light irradiation, P1a/2e/3a could generate 1O2 efficiently apart from the physical damage
    effect, leading to much stronger inhibition against MRSA with an MIC value of ∼30 μg/mL. In addition, the raw monomers
    1a, 2e, and 3a of P1a/2e/3a all exhibited minimal bacteria inhibition even in the presence of light irradiation, which
    further highlighted advantageous P1a/2e/3a with remarkable PDT potency (Figure S19).


    Furthermore, the morphology change of MRSA upon diverse treatments was observed by TEM and SEM analysis (Figure 4D and
    E). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, both the control sample and the single light-treating sample exhibited a smooth
    membrane surface and an intact membrane structure, while the cell surface of MRSA became rough and out of shape under
    the treatment of P1a/2e/3a in the dark state; many micelles were found to be around the bacteria, demonstrating efficient
    binding, adhesion, and further fusion with the MRSA membrane. Finally, much more significant membrane shrinking and deformation
    were observed upon micelle binding and extra light irradiation.


    To investigate the biocompatibility of the polyelectrolytes, MTT assays were performed for P1a/2e/3a upon incubation with
    primary skin fibroblast cells for 24 h. P1a/2e/3a showed undetectable toxicity toward the cells even up to 175 μg/mL under
    light irradiation (Figure S20), exhibiting good biocompatibility and antibacterial selectivity, which was favorable for
    in vivo applications.


    An in vivo bacteria inhibition experiment was conducted on a MRSA-infected mouse burn model. 63 Different treatments were
    applied to the MRSA-infected burn sites, and the recovery process was evaluated in 14 days (Figure 5A). An effectively
    accelerated wound healing process was observed when treated with vancomycin or P1a/2e/3a with light irradiation, as compared
    to the control group (Figure 5B and C). After the whole treating process in 14 days, the mice were sacrificed and their
    wound tissues were harvested for further evaluation. Although vancomycin could also enhance the wound healing process,
    the quantitative experiments showed that the inhibition effect of P1a/2e/3a under white light irradiation was much better
    than vancomycin, the golden standard for Gram-positive bacteria treatment (Figure 5D, Figure S21). Histologic analysis
    was conducted to further evaluate the treatment effect (Figure 5E). Normal mouse skin was highly heterogeneous tissue,
    containing epidermis, dermis with hair follicle, and subcutaneous layer. At the 14th day, the control group only showed
    a partially re-epithelialized and thickened epidermis, while tissue of the P1a/2e/3a under the light-irradiation-treated
    group showed an obvious re-epithelialized epidermis, exhibiting intact skin microstructure comparable with normal tissue.
    Thus, the in vivo MRSA-infected mouse burn model demonstrated that the photodynamic effect of P1a/2e/3a could inhibit
    MRSA infection in the burn injury mouse model and effectively accelerate the healing process.'

  content: In summary, we have developed an efficient one-pot polymerization route to in situ generate functional azonia-containing
    polyelectrolytes using readily accessible nonionic reactants and commercially available cheap ionic species. Compared
    with traditional synthetic strategies of polyelectrolytes, this new strategy did not require a postmodification step or
    expensive ionic monomers. The polymerization proceeded efficiently in air with high tolerance to the monomer feed ratio,
    generating polyelectrolytes in excellent yields (up to 99%) with high molecular weights (up to 28700) in high atom economy.
    With electron-deficient azonia fused rings in the polymer main chain, the emission color of the resulting polyelectrolytes
    could be easily tuned by changing the electron donor. With high luminescence in the solid state, good processing ability,
    and high refractive indices, these polymers were excellent materials for fluorescent photopatterns and promising for optical
    applications. Notably, the azonia-containing polyelectrolytes had a strong ROS generation ability and could impressively
    kill the drug resistant superbug. P1a/2e/3a was demonstrated to effectively kill MRSA both in vitro and in the MRSA-infected
    mouse burn model. The efficient one-pot synthetic methodology to azonia-containing polyelectrolytes provided a new strategy
    for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes, greatly enriching the family of polyelectrolytes. Current charge-generating polymerization
    provided these prominent functional positively charged polyelectrolytes, which were promising candidates for various biomedical
    applications, such as tissue engineering, surface modification, and self-healing materials.
