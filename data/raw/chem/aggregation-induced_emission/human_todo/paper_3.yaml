  content: New agents with particular specificity toward targeted bacteria and superefficacy in antibacterial activity are
    urgently needed in facing the crisis of worldwide antibiotic resistance. Herein, a novel strategy by equipping bacteriophage
    (PAP) with photodynamic inactivation (PDI)-active AIEgens (luminogens with aggregation-induced emission property) was
    presented to generate a type of AIE−PAP bioconjugate with superior capability for both targeted imaging and synergistic
    killing of certain species of bacteria. The targeting ability inherited from the bacteriophage enabled the bioconjugates
    to specifically recognize the host bacteria with preserved infection activity of phage itself. Meanwhile, the AIE characteristic
    empowered them a monitoring functionality, and the real-time tracking of their interactions with targets was therefore
    realized via convenient fluorescence imaging. More importantly, the PDI-active AIEgens could serve as powerful in situ
    photosensitizers producing high-efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS) under white light irradiation. As a result, selective
    targeting and synergistic killing of both antibiotic-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were successfully
    achieved in in vitro and in vivo antibacterial tests with excellent biocompatibility. This novel AIE−phage integrated
    strategy would diversify the existing pool of antibacterial agents and inspire the development of promising drug candidates
    in the future.

  content: 'Bacterial infectious diseases have become one of the greatest global challenges, which seriously threaten the
    health and civilization of human beings,1,2 and increasing evidence revealed that bacteria can also indirectly promote
    the occurrence and progression of other diseases, such as cancer.3−6 On the other hand, bacterial communities are indispensable
    to human health, such as intestinal microbes whose balances determined the nutrient absorption from digested food in our
    bodies and should be always protected from unintentional damage.7,8 Therefore, in the antibacterial battle, promoting
    an antibacterial agent in terms of targeting and killing efficiency is persistently pursued.


    Antibiotics have been predominately employed in the treatment of bacterial infections since the discovery of penicillin.
    However, by use of antibiotics, even narrow-spectrum antibiotics, both harmful bacteria and beneficial microbes could
    be killed, resulting in side effects such as diarrhea, constipation, and inflammatory bowels.9,10 The global abuse or
    overuse of antibiotics has promoted bacterial evolution and intensified the antibiotic resistance.11,12 The situation
    is worsening with the rapidly increased difficulty and cost in producing new robust antibacterial agents.13 Thus, it is
    highly desirable to develop pinpoint accurate drugs to kill certain species of harmful pathogens. Fortunately, bacteriophage
    had been verified with particular specificity to their hosts14 and could evolve synchronously to adapt to infect resistant
    bacteria.15,16 Phagotherapy, which was used before antibiotics were discovered, is now going through a revival driven
    by the crisis of antibiotic resistance.17 However, the bacteriophage alone normally shows a moderate antibacterial effect,
    hindering the curing of infectious diseases, especially the acute infections.18 Because of the lack of imaging moieties,
    the processes of phagotherapy including target recognition, binding, and infection could not be easily monitored, resulting
    in difficult real-time evaluation of therapeutic performance. The introduction of sensitively detectable “radar” with
    powerful “weaponry” will therefore promote phagotherapy as a deluxe ensemble for both visualization of its infection process
    and their subsequent discriminative eradication.


    Fluorescence imaging technology has emerged as a rapid, facile, and powerful tool for visualization and tracking of bioanalytes
    with merits of high sensitivity, low cost, and fast responsiveness.19−21 Surpassing traditional organic fluorophores that
    have usually suffered severe photobleaching and moderate signal-to-noise ratio, the newly developed luminogens with aggregation-induced
    emission characteristics (AIEgens) are becoming attractive candidates for advanced biosensing and imaging application.22−25
    AIEgens display weak emission in solution but intensified fluorescence upon aggregation via the restriction of intramolecular
    motion.26 The unique light-up fluorescence with negligible background noise and remarkable photostability qualifies AIEgens
    to be a superior choice in long-lasting fluorescence imaging and tracking for dynamic bioprocesses.27−29 What is more,
    with intelligent molecular designing, AIE-based materials display exceptional photodynamic activity for the treatments
    of malignant cancer and the inactivation of bacteria.30−34 However, the specific discrimination of a certain species of
    bacterium has not yet been previously demonstrated by AIEgens, making them unsuitable for accurately removing certain
    targeted bacterium.35,36 Although the bioorthogonal method showed improvement in targeted labeling, the incorporation
    of exogenous reactive groups was demanding with challenges for large-scale applications.37,38 These limitations propelled
    us to engineer AIEgens with pinpoint specificity to realize the discriminative imaging and killing of a certain species
    of bacterium.


    Herein, a novel strategy was presented by integrating AIEgens with bacteriophage to form a new class of antimicrobial
    bioconjugates (TVP−PAP) for the imaging and killing of a certain species of bacterium. Phage targeting P. aeruginosa was
    chosen as a prototype. The AIE molecule, TVP-S, was designed with excellent fluorescence properties and efficient PDI
    activity. Through a simple amino−carboxyl reaction, the AIEgens could be facilely modified onto the surface of phage entity.
    The generated TVP−PAP perfectly preserved the properties of both AIEgen and phage, with intrinsic AIE fluorescence serving
    the function of real-time monitoring of phage−bacterium interaction and particular specificity in bacterial targeting.
    What is more, the synergistic antibacterial effect with efficiency that significantly surpassing both individuals in the
    bioconjugates was achieved by integrating the PDI activity of AIEgen and the infection ability of phage itself. Superior
    performance of the bioconjugate was also demonstrated in in vivo treatment of infectious wounds caused by both antibiotic-sensitive
    and MDR P. aeruginosa. This novel strategy by integrating specific targeting, discriminative imaging, and synergistic
    killing functionalities together into an AIE−phage bioconjugate is a promising methodology for the design of next-generation
    antibacterial agents.'

  content: 'The AIE compound TVP-S was designed and synthesized through three-step reactions (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Its
    structure was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high resolution mass spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction
    (XRD, Figure S2) as shown in the Supporting Information. Attributed to the existence of a positively charged pyridinium
    group and the hydrophilic carboxyl group in its structure, TVP-S could be well dissolved in a high-polarity solvent including
    water. More importantly, the activated carboxyl group in TVP-S structure endows it capability to straightforwardly react
    with the amino group that is widespread in the bioorganism. The obvious absorbance of TVP-S in the range between 400 and
    600 nm with a maximum at 457 nm showed its strong capability of visible light absorption (Figure 1b). As TVP-S could be
    well dissolved in solvent with large polarity, we investigated its AIE features in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/chloroform
    (CHCl3) mixtures via varying the fractions of CHCl3. As shown in Figure 1c, TVP-S exhibited an apparent AIE property.
    Fluorescence could hardly be observed when it was dissolved in a good solvent, DMSO, whereas strong aggregated-state emission
    with 47 times enhancement in intensity appeared when the fraction of chloroform reached 99% (Figure 1d). Their maximum
    emissions in the aggregation state are located at 630 nm, indicating its long-wavelength emission properties and large
    Stokes shifts. The significant increase in the absolute fluorescence quantum yield of TVP-S in chloroform (33.3%) versus
    in DMSO (1.6%) further verified its typical AIE feature. BSA and bacteria could also induce the aggregation of TVP-S in
    aqueous solution with significant emission enhancements (Figures S3 and S4). Moreover, dynamic light scattering (DLS)
    analysis was performed to confirm the aggregation process by decreasing the solvent polarity, with obvious increases in
    the average hydrodynamic diameters (Figure S5).


    The strong absorption of TVP-S in the visible light region could lead to the utilization of white light as the source
    for PDI-based antibacterial application. The ROS generation efficiency of TVP-S was initially determined by using of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin
    diacetate (DCFH) as indicator, which could emit fluorescence with a “turn-on” process triggered by ROS. As depicted in
    Figure S6, DCFH alone was nonemissive and remained almost constant during 10 min white light irradiation (∼4.2 mW cm−2).
    In contrast, the emission intensity of DCFH gradually increased and reached 23-fold within the same period exposure to
    white light irradiation in the presence of TVP-S. In addition, up to 72.3% of singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield for TVP-S
    was determined by using 9,10-anthracenediylbis(methylene)dimalonic acid (ABDA) as an indicator and Rose Bengal (RB) as
    a standard with ∼75% quantum yield for 1O2 39,40 (Figure 1e,f and Figure S7). Sodium azide (NaN3) as a 1O2 quencher41
    was further added to the ABDA solution in the presence of TVP-S. As shown in Figure S8, the decomposition rate of ABDA
    slowed down gradually with increase of the concentration of NaN3, and 2.0 mg/mL NaN3 could completely inhibit the decomposition
    of ABDA, implying 1O2 was indeed generated by TVP-S. Meanwhile, no obvious enhancements could be observed in the signal
    from the hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HBF) indicator for hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) indicator
    for superoxide radicals (O2•−), indicating that 1O2 accounted for nearly all of the ROS generated by TVP-S (Figures S9
    and S10). As the 1O2 should be stemmed from the energy transfer process between the triplet oxygen and triplet excited-state
    photosensitizer, we further checked the existence of triplet excitons in TVP-S. As shown in Figure S11, TVP-S exhibited
    strong phosphorescence emission with a lifetime of up to 31.3 μs at 77 K, clearly demonstrating its efficient intersystem
    crossing (ISC) to the triplet excited state. Theoretically, this is also quite rational given TVP-S contains a Br atom
    which usually boosts the ISC process in organic molecular systems (the well-known heavy atom effect42).


    With the activated carboxyl group in its molecular structure, TVP-S could facilely react with the amino group in the outside
    proteins of bacteriophage and was ready to form the AIE-featured phage bioconjugate (TVP−PAP). As illustrated in Figure
    2a, the intensified absorbance of PAP phage in the range 400−500 nm after AIEgen modification confirmed the successful
    bioconjugation reaction between TVP-S and PAP. According to concentration titrations, the molar extinction coefficients
    of TVP-S and PAP were calculated to be 1.94 × 10^4 and 3.41 × 10^10 M−1 cm−1, respectively (Figure 2b,c and Figure S12).
    The molar ratio of TVP-S to PAP in the TVP−PAP bioconjugate was determined to be on average 8200 AIEgen molecules bound
    on one PAP entity, according to the enhanced absorbance at 457 nm of TVP−PAP compared to bare PAP. Because of the robust
    ROS generation capability of prepared AIE-phage bioconjugates (Figure S13), the particular bacterial recognition, real-time
    tracking, and synergistic bacterial killing were highly expectable (Figure 2d).'

  content: 'Taking advantage of the specific recognition feature of phage and the unique AIE property from TVP-S, the efficiency
    of bacterial imaging using TVP−PAP was first examined on its target bacteria (P. aeruginosa). As shown in Figure 3a, P.
    aeruginosa could be stained with bright fluorescence upon incubating with TVP−PAP for 30 min, and the staining efficiency
    could reach 100% efficiency (also shown in Figure S14). Compared to the commercial cell membrane staining dye, DiO, P.
    aeruginosa could be light-up stained by the TVP−PAP probe with a much higher staining efficiency (Figure S15). To test
    the particular specificity of this TVP−PAP probe stemming from the inherent recognition capability of bacteriophage, we
    employed two types of bacteria, G− A. baumannii (Figure S16) and G+ S. aureus (Figure S17), as controls. The results showed
    that even for the process extending to 60 min, neither bacteria could be stained by TVP−PAP probes, and no apparent fluorescence
    signals emitted out from either of them in the AIE fluorescence channel.


    Encouraged by this exciting result, we further conducted real-time tracking of the bacterial staining process in the mixed
    microbes including A. baumannii (G−) and host bacteria P. aeruginosa (G−) to verify the particular selectivity of the
    TVP−PAP probe to its target P. aeruginosa. Clearly, the arrow indicated A. baumannii could never be stained throughout
    the whole incubation process by monitoring both the bright-field pictures and the fluorescence images as shown in Figure
    3b. In contrast, the recognition and attachment between TVP−PAP and P. aeruginosa started after 10 min coincubation to
    emit out a fluorescence signal. With the time elapsing to 30 min, the fluorescence signal became gradually stronger, and
    more detailed tracking of TVP−PAP was also carried out, in which the fluorescence signal of bacteria intensified to a
    platform after 30 min, consistent with the necessary time for phage targeted binding and infection to the host (Figure
    S18). These results of nearly all P. aeruginosa being successfully stained while no fluorescence being observed from A.
    baumannii demonstrated the particular specificity of TVP−PAP probe to its target bacteria. The use of AIEgen alone for
    bacterial imaging via nonspecific electrostatic or hydrophobic−hydrophobic interaction indicated that it is impossible
    to realize the absolute discrimination of a certain species of bacterium.31 The stable and efficient staining of G− bacteria
    was always challenged due to the blocking of their complicated cell walls.43,44 The introduction of bacteriophage could
    guide AIEgen to realize discriminative light-up imaging likely equipped with a sensing “radar”. The TVP−PAP carried AIEgen
    to anchor and aggregate on the surface of target bacteria, resulting in the enrichment of a large number of AIEgens at
    local site with enhancement in their fluorescence emission for light-up imaging of bacteria. Therefore, significant advancement
    in targeting specificity could be achieved by the TVP−PAP bioconjugate compared to the previous AIEgens that suffered
    moderate selectivity.35'

  content: 'Inspired by the exceptional bacteria-targeting ability of PAP and high 1O2 generation efficiency of AIEgens, we
    next checked their synergistic antibacterial performances in facing antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P. aeruginosa. The times
    for incubation and white light illumination were first optimized by examining the survival rate of P. aeruginosa. To avoid
    the instant decrease of bacterial survival rate, a small amount of TVP−PAP (9.54 × 10^5 PFU mL−1) was added in each group.
    As shown in Figure S19, with elongation of the incubation time from 0 to 30 min, the bacterial survival rate decreased
    from 98.3% to 74.7%, consistent with the saturation time in the above imaging process (Figure S18). Next, we fixed the
    incubation time at 30 min and then irradiated the bacterial suspensions by white light (4.2 mW cm−2) for 2, 10, 30, and
    60 min. Nearly 79% of P. aeruginosa could be eradicated after 30 min illumination, and the efficacy remained unchanged
    even upon irradiation prolonged to 60 min, indicating the saturation of ROS generation at this condition. Furthermore,
    the bacterial survival rate significantly increased after reversing the sequence of incubation and illumination, suggesting
    the critical role of phage targeting and infection before TVP−PAP-guided ROS generation on the bacterial surface (Figure
    S20). Thus, light illumination following 30 min coincubation was applied in the subsequent antibacterial tests.


    The synergistic antibacterial effect of TVP−PAP was next tested by comparing with the same molar concentrations of individual
    AIEgen and PAP entity. As shown in Figure 4a, for antibiotic-sensitive P. aeruginosa, neither incubation in darkness (control
    I-30 and control I-60) nor with further white light irradiation (control I-30 and L-30) could pose an apparent influence
    on the bacterial survival rate. Similarly, TVP-S alone could neither inhibit the bacterial growth crossing the tested
    concentration range (4.33−21.65 pM, according to the 3.18:1−15.9:1 molar ratio), no matter with or without light irradiation.
    It was possible that the nonspecific AIEgens and their relative low concentration on the surface of bacteria weakened
    the destructive effect. In contrast, upon PAP treatment, the antibacterial effect initiated when its concentration increased
    to 9.54 × 10^5 PFU mL−1 (according to the 9.54:1 molar ratio) under darkness (PAP I-60). The bacterial survival rate further
    decreased to 48.3% when the concentration increased to 15.9 × 10^5 PFU mL−1 (according to the 15.9:1 molar ratio) in a
    dose-dependent manner. This result indicated the inherited infection capability of the TVP−PAP bioconjugate from the PAP
    moiety. With assistance from AIEgen, TVP−PAP showed a slightly higher antibacterial efficiency in the darkness compared
    to PAP alone (TVP−PAP I-30 vs PAP I-30) crossing the tested concentration range, possibly contributed by the dark toxicity
    of the AIEgens enriched on the surface of P. aeruginosa. Upon elongating the interaction time for another 30 min (TVP−PAP
    I-60), this dark toxicity became much stronger and could cause another 20% decrease in the bacterial survival rate at
    the concentration of 9.54 × 10^5 PFU mL−1. Furthermore, by harnessing the extra PDI activity under white light irradiation,
    we could observe significant enhancements in the antibacterial efficiency (TVP−PAP I-30 and L-30). With the concentration
    of TVP−PAP increasing to 1.59 × 10^6 PFU mL−1, the bacteria survival rate rapidly decreased to 6.9%. The agar plate pictures
    also verified the excellent antibacterial effect from TVP−PAP bioconjugates which was much superior to TVP-S and PAP alone
    (Figure S21), and complete inhibition could be achieved by increasing TVP−PAP to 2.544 × 10^6 PFU mL−1 (Figures S22 and
    S23). PAP could keep an infectious capability after TVP-S modification for at least 1 week (Figures S24 and S25).


    Extending to the clinical isolated MDR P. aeruginosa, a similar dose-dependent antibacterial profile was presented upon
    TVP−PAP treatment. When the concentration of TVP−PAP increases to 6.36 × 10^7 PFU mL−1, the eradication efficiency could
    reach 64.8% (TVP−PAP I-60), and the efficiency could even rise up to 99.5% under white light irradiation (TVP−PAP I-30
    and L-30). In contrast, at the same concentration, the individual AIEgen (TVP-S I-30 and L-30) and PAP (PAP I-30 and L-30)
    could only kill 7.0% and 46.5% bacteria, respectively, definitely verifying the significantly synergistic antibacterial
    effect boosted by the PDI activity of AIEgens.


    The targeted killing is another critical consideration in antibacterial test. Herein, the character of PAP was introduced
    for the bacterial discrimination and their following targeted killing. This capability of TVP−PAP was checked in two-component
    systems by culturing host bacteria, P. aeruginosa (G−), with nonhost bacteria, A. baumannii (G−) or S. aureus (G+), respectively.
    As shown in Figure 4b,c, in the presence of light irradiation, P. aeruginosa was effectively killed, and few colonies
    formed upon TVP−PAP treatment, whereas the colony quantity of A. baumannii or S. aureus was nearly unaffected, consistent
    with the above selective staining result of TVP−PAP to its target. The phage-guided targeting was proposed to play a critical
    role in achieving this super-antibacterial performance. PAP first specifically recognized the antibiotic-sensitive or
    MDR P. aeruginosa through its tail protein binding to lipopolysaccharide of the host bacteria.14 Then the AIEgens (low
    to 21.65 pM in 1.59 × 10^6 PFU mL−1 TVP−PAP) were enriched on the bacterial surface. Following the infection process of
    phage itself, the AIEgens generating efficient 1O2 in situ under white light irradiation could further promote the destruction
    on the targeted bacteria. Compared to the previous PDI-based antibacterial tests demanding up to several micromolar AIEgens,36,45−47
    our phage-guided method showed a fairly higher efficacy and would remarkably mitigate the toxic concerns regarding the
    random interaction of traditional photosensitizers with the surrounding biomolecules.'

  content: 'The unique fluorescence property of AIEgen was also harnessed for real-time monitoring this targeting and killing
    process. As shown in Figure 5, the successful staining of P. aeruginosa was first achieved by incubating with TVP−PAP
    bioconjugates, with emitting out robust fluorescence signal under imaging (also quantitated in Figure S26). After exposure
    to white light starting from the time point at 30 min, bacterial morphologies became gradually blurred with illumination
    lasting, with obvious appearance of fragments in the bright field. In the fluorescence field, signals disappeared in a
    large fraction of bacteria after 10 min irradiation, along with the apparent agglomeration of bacterial cells. These change
    in morphology and fluidity indicated destruction happened on the targeted bacteria. To MDR P. aeruginosa, the real-time
    tracking was performed upon interaction with a higher concentration of TVP−PAP (6.36 × 10^7 PFU mL−1) (Figure S27). Similarly,
    after 30 min coincubation, it was easy to observe the bacterial cell fragment whose amount obviously increased with the
    elapsing of white light irradiation time, indicating the aggravating damage to the MDR bacteria.


    To gain more insights into the antibacterial effect of TVP−PAP, SEM imaging was employed to monitor the morphological
    changes on antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P. aeruginosa. As shown in Figure 6a, without TVP−PAP treatment, P. aeruginosa
    possessed a smooth surface with an intact cell wall and well-stereo-shaped body. In contrast, after treatment with TVP−PAP
    and white light irradiation, the cell walls of P. aeruginosa apparently became rough and even ruptured with the disappearance
    of its original stereo shape. Also, numerous holes appeared on the bacterial surface. These holes punched by phage would
    accelerate the permeation of 1O2 into the bacteria cytoplasm and caused further damages to P. aeruginosa (Figure 6b).
    A similar result with coarse cell surfaces and collapsed morphologies could also be observed in the case of MDR P. aeruginosa,
    verifying the tremendous destruction from the synergistic effect48,49 of TVP−PAP bioconjugates (Figure S28).'

  content: 'Inspired by the outstanding bacteria targeting and elimination activity of TVP−PAP in vitro, we further extended
    antibacterial examinations to in vivo using a mouse model with antibiotic-sensitive or MDR P. aeruginosa infectious skin
    wounds. The biocompatibility of TVP−PAP on normal cells was first checked. As illustrated in Figure S29, for both dark
    and illumination groups, the viability of HaCaT cells still remained up to 83% even the TVP−PAP concentration went up
    to 8.45 × 10^10 PFU mL−1. The imaging result of HaCaT cell incubated with TVP−PAP further verified its low toxicity as
    no obvious fluorescence signal could be detected (Figure S30). Compared to the TVP-S molecules, the improved biocompatibility
    of TVP−PAP provided a basis for their in vivo antibacterial application (Figure S31).


    After model building, the antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P. aeruginosa infected mice were randomly separated into three
    groups with various treatments (as depicted in Figure 7a). Through monitoring the healing processes of the wounds, it
    was clear that the mice treated with TVP−PAP nearly recovered at 8 day post-treatment (Figure 7b,d). Both of the relative
    wound sizes infected by antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P. aeruginosa decreased to below 10%, significantly smaller compared
    to the PBS control or TVP−PAP alone group (Figure 7c,e). The wound healing was much faster than the previous reports using
    AIE polymer32 and an AIEgen−antibiotic conjugate in the case of G− bacterial infection,45 demonstrating the superefficiency
    of the phage-guided bacterial killing. The infected skin tissues were then collected, and bacterial colony numbers were
    counted to quantify the antibacterial efficacy of TVP−PAP. It turned out that both numbers of bacteria in the groups treated
    with TVP−PAP plus white light irradiation were much smaller comparing to the PBS control and TVP−PAP alone treated group
    (Figure S32). The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining also proved the superior outcome of TVP−PAP treatment plus white
    light irradiation by showing intact histological characteristics. Whereas in control and TVP−PAP treated alone, invaded
    lymphocytes could be obviously observed (Figure 8). Collectively, these outstanding performances in vivo suggested the
    great potential of TVP−PAP bioconjugates in the application of target bacterial killing and infectious disease therapeutics.'

  content: In summary, we proposed a novel antibacterial strategy by integrating the fluorescence monitoring, phage targeting,
    and AIE-based photodynamic inactivation together toward a certain species of bacterium. Benefiting from the unique fluorescence
    property, effective 1O2 generation capability, particular targeting specificity, TVP−PAP had been successfully utilized
    in the discriminative imaging, selective and efficient killing of targeted bacteria, without apparent influence in the
    nontargeting bacteria or the normal mammalian cells. The in vitro test demonstrated that even MDR P. aeruginosa could
    be killed with nearly 100% efficiency attributing to the synergistic effect within TVP−PAP. Additionally, in vivo study
    verified that the healing rates of both antibiotic-sensitive and MDR bacteria infected wound could be significantly accelerated.
    These remarkable performances validated that the superior potential of TVP−PAP bioconjugate in synergistic bacterial recognizing
    and killing that surpassing each individual component within the bioconjugate. Through changing to other phages, this
    AIE-phage conjugated strategy could be extended to be a universal approach for producing particular specific antibacterial
    agents, holding great potential to the treatment of bacterial infections as well as diseases indirectly influenced by
    bacteria, such as the chemo- or immunotherapy resistant cancer with critical bacterial participation.
