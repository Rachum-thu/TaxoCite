# aggregation-induced emission

## Mechanistic foundations
**Description:** Core physical mechanisms governing enhanced emission upon aggregation and solidification.

### Restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM)
**Description:** Active motions quench emission in solution; aggregation immobilizes motions to brighten luminescence.

### Through-space interaction (TSI)
**Description:** Electron communication across spatially proximate orbitals creates effective chromophores without bond conjugation.

### Intersystem crossing engineering (SOC and ΔEST)
**Description:** Controlling spin–orbit coupling and singlet–triplet gaps tunes triplet formation and decay.

### Aggregate-induced rigidification
**Description:** Crystal packing suppresses conical intersections and non-radiative decay, strengthening and blue-shifting emission.

## Aggregate influence paradigms
**Description:** Holistic categories describing how aggregation alters properties relative to isolated molecules.

### Activation
**Description:** Aggregation stabilizes emissive conformations, turning dormant molecules bright without structural change.

### Transformation
**Description:** Aggregation alters conformation, packing, or environment, converting properties from one type to another.

### Emergence
**Description:** New emissive species form by clustering interactions, absent in isolated molecules or ions.

## Research branches
**Description:** Subfields evolved from AIE showcasing diverse aggregate-enabled photophysical phenomena.

### Crystallization-induced emission (CIE)
**Description:** Emission specifically strengthened upon crystallization due to rigidified structures and minimal π–π quenching.

### Room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP)
**Description:** Solid-state strategies stabilize triplets and promote intersystem crossing to realize organic phosphorescence.

### Aggregation-induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF)
**Description:** Aggregates enable reversed intersystem crossing and efficient delayed fluorescence in neat films.

### Anti-Kasha transition (AKT)
**Description:** Higher excited-state emission becomes allowed in aggregates by suppressing internal conversion pathways.

### Clusterization-triggered emission (CTE)
**Description:** Nonconjugated systems emit via heteroatom and π clusters formed on aggregation.

### Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)
**Description:** Chiral assemblies of AIEgens amplify circular polarization with strong aggregate-state emission.

### Aggregation-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (AIG-ROS)
**Description:** Aggregate formation enhances triplet generation, enabling efficient reactive oxygen species production.

## Applications and engineering strategies
**Description:** Practical uses and design approaches leveraging aggregate-state control of emissive properties.

### Optoelectronic emitters and devices
**Description:** Aggregate-optimized luminogens power OLEDs, OLETs, lasers with reduced quenching and roll-off.

### Photodynamic therapy and theranostics
**Description:** AIE-based photosensitizers generate ROS in aggregates for imaging-guided treatments.

### X-ray scintillation and radiography
**Description:** Aggregate packing modulates scintillation efficiency for sensitive X-ray detection and imaging.

### Crystal and aggregate engineering strategies
**Description:** Polymorphism, co-crystallization, and doping tailor packing and excited-state behaviors.

### Intermolecular interaction modulation
**Description:** Hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, and aurophilicity regulate emission, ISC and stability.
