  ## Introduction

  <block id="1">

  Organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) [1−5] has emerged as an attractive
  research topic with multiple potential applications in optoelectronic devices, information
  anticounterfeiting, biomedical imaging, phosphorescence probes, and biosensing.
  This interest is due to the full utilization of the radiative relaxation of the
  triplet excited state. Although numerous RTP materials have been developed, their
  inefficient phosphorescence at room temperature is the main limitation for practical
  applications. The primary challenges include two aspects: First, the spin forbidden
  property leads to insufficient intersystem crossing (ISC), and the intrinsic phosphorescence
  quantum yield is generally lower than the theoretical limit. Second, traditional
  methods such as crystallization, matrix rigidification, and supramolecular self-assembly
  rely on constructing rigid confinement environments to enhance exciton stability,
  but these approaches sacrifice material processability, making it difficult to meet
  practical applications. In recent years, researchers have been trying to develop
  different strategies to improve the RTP efficiency, including vacuum evaporation
  and solution processing-type RTP materials. The main strategies include: introducing
  heteroatoms (O, N, S, and P) with abundant lone pair electrons to enhance spin orbit
  coupling (SOC), building twist donor−acceptor (D-A) structures to reduce the single
  triplet energy gap difference (ΔEST), and constructing rigid confinements to suppress
  molecular motion to reduce nonradiative transitions (Figure 1). For example, Su
  et al. reported a phenoxyselenide donor-triazine acceptor molecule exhibiting a
  strong SOC (S0, T1) of 108.48 cm−1 and multiple hydrogen bonds that rigidify the
  molecular skeleton. The corresponding vacuum deposited organic light-emitting diode
  (OLED) device achieved an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 19.5%. Additionally,
  Zhao et al. demonstrated a rigid indolocarbazole-xanthenone system with a ∼60° twist
  angle, achieving a small ΔEST (0.28 eV) and a high PLQY (72%), leading to a nondoped
  vacuum-deposited OLED with a record EQE of 24.9%.


  In comparison, solution-processed OLEDs offer advantages such as low-cost fabrication,
  high material utilization, simple processing (e.g., inkjet printing or spin coating),
  and compatibility with flexible/large-area devices. Early molecular designs focused
  on enhancing SOC through heteroatoms/heavy atoms. For example, Ceroni et al. reported
  a thiophenol-functionalized benzene derivative with six flexible substituents, but
  excessive molecular motion limited its device EQE to only 0.1%. Later, Ding et al.
  developed an oxygen-containing D-A-structured RTP polymer, where oxygen atoms reduced
  orbital overlap to enhance SOC while polymer rigidity suppressed nonradiative decay.
  This system achieved a solution-processed OLED EQE of 9.7%. However, solution-processed
  RTP devices currently show significantly lower efficiencies than vacuum-deposited
  counterparts (EQE < 10% vs >20%). The bottleneck stems from conflicting requirements:
  solution processability necessitates flexible molecular designs, whereas suppressing
  nonradiative triplet deactivation demands rigid environments.


  Dendrimers hold potential to construct efficient solution-processed RTP materials
  owing to their unique advantages, including abundant functional adjustability, high
  morphological stability, and excellent solution processability. These properties
  may overcome the efficiency bottleneck of solution-processed RTP-OLED devices. However,
  research on RTP dendrimers remains rare due to the absence of established molecular
  design principles. The conventional donor-dendronization strategy—introducing dendrons
  into donors to form acceptor−donor−dendron (A-D-D′) architectures—has failed to
  exhibit RTP. This approach excessively strengthens electron-donating effects, depletes
  hole density in the acceptor’s triplet state, and consequently weakens spin−orbit
  coupling (SOC) while impeding efficient spin-flip processes. A promising alternative
  involves increasing the acceptor’s triplet hole density through acceptor dendronization.
  For instance, the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule BPSAF
  combines a strong carbonyl acceptor with a spiro[acridine-9,9’-fluorene] (SAF) donor,
  achieving both a small ΔEST and a large SOC constant. Nevertheless, despite efficient
  ISC in BPSAF and other TADF systems, RTP emission remains elusive. Highly branched
  dendrimers, such as 1,3,5-tris(3′,6′-di-tert-butyl-9H-[3,9′-bicarbazol]-9-yl)benzene
  (TC), contain rigid and bulky peripheral carbazole dendrons. When these dendrons
  are attached to a benzophenone (BP) acceptor to form a donor−acceptor−dendron (D-A-D′)-typed
  asymmetric dendrimer (dTC-BPSAF), they not only increase intramolecular interactions,
  which lead to energy level splitting and an enhancement of ISC channels, but also
  enhance the hole density of triplet and 3 (n, π*) characteristics in the BP acceptor,
  resulting in high SOC constants for efficient triplet radiation.


  In addition, the dTC-BPSAF dendrimer also demonstrates multiple molecular interactions
  and a rigid dendronized structure, which lead to restricted molecular motion, stabilized
  triplet excitons, and suppressed nonradiative transitions, thereby resulting in
  efficient RTP emission in solution. Experiments conducted with the dendrimer in
  ambient dilute toluene solution demonstrate that despite the presence of dissolved
  oxygen at a concentration of 8.67 × 10−3 M at room temperature, the RTP emission
  remains ultrastable in both aerated and deaerated solutions. These results indicate
  that the dendrons attached to the acceptor can also effectively protect the triplet
  excitons of dTC-BPSAF from being quenched by oxygen, thereby achieving ultrastable
  RTP emission in ambient solution with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of
  34%. Furthermore, to further reduce molecular motion and quenching of triplet excitons,
  the dTC-BPSAF dendrimer was doped into the host films, resulting in a high PLQY
  of ∼100%. Additionally, the solution-processed RTP-OLEDs achieved a record-high
  EQE of 25.1%. These remarkable results validate the effectiveness of the acceptor
  dendronization strategy for achieving efficient RTP both in solution and in solid
  states, elucidating the mechanism of restricting molecular motion to achieve efficient
  RTP.

  ### Quantum-Chemical Calculations

  <block id="3">

  The acceptor dendronization strategy can effectively regulate the population of
  triplet excitons by increasing the splitting of triplet energy levels and enhancing
  the proportion of locally excited (LE) characteristics of the acceptor in the lowest
  triplet state (T1) state. These two factors are anticipated to promote ISC processes
  from the lowest singlet (S1) to T1 and triplet radiative transitions from the T1
  back to the ground state (S0), thus achieving highly efficient RTP. To analyze and
  predict the feasibility and reliability of the acceptor-dendronized strategy, quantum-chemical
  calculations were performed on dTC-BPSAF, BPSAF, and the donor-dendronized dendrimer
  BPSAF-DCz for comparison, to investigate two crucial photophysical processes: (1)
  the enhancement of ISC spin-flipping processes from the S1 to triplet state (Tn)
  (kISC) and (2) the facilitation of the phosphorescent decay rate from the T1 to
  the S0 (kP). The ISC process was evaluated based on eq 1. |kISC| ∝ Σ n |HSOC|2 exp(−ΔEST/kBT)
  where a smaller ΔEST, coupled with more ISC channels and larger spin−orbit coupling
  operator (ĤSOC), can enhance kISC.


  First, dTC-BPSAF inherits the HOMO and LUMO distributions of BPSAF, resulting in
  a very small ΔES1−T1 (0.02 eV). Second, the introduction of dendrons increases the
  density of triplet states and reduces the triplet−triplet energy gaps (ΔETT), which
  increases valid ISC channels (ΔEST ≤ 0.3 eV and SOC ≥ 0.3 cm−1) from S1 to Tn. Specifically,
  the number of valid ISC channels of dTC-BPSAF is three (S1→T1, T2, and T9), while
  the ISC channels of BPSAF is only one (S1→T2 with a ΔES1‑T2 of −0.09 eV). In comparison,
  donor-dendronized BPSAF-DCz also exhibits only one ISC channel (S1→T2) with a ΔES1‑T2
  of −0.24 eV. Although donor dendronization increases the density of triplet states,
  it fails to enhance the effective ISC channels. These results indicate that acceptor
  dendronization is an effective strategy to enhance the ISC process by increasing
  the number of ISC channels.


  Additionally, the large SOC (T1, S0) and the transition dipole moment between the
  T1 and S0 states (μT d1→Sd0) are also significant factors in achieving efficient
  RTP, and the wave function properties of T1 are crucial elements affecting SOC (T1,
  S0) and μT d1→Sd0. In dTC-BPSAF, electrons are predominantly localized on the BP
  acceptor (83.0%), while holes are mainly localized on the SAF donor (57.9%), with
  a partial localization on the BP acceptor (25.6%). In contrast, for BPSAF, the T1
  state exhibits hole and electron distributions that are separately localized on
  the SAF donor (94.2%) and the BP acceptor (98.6%), respectively. The character of
  T1 of BPSAF, which is predominantly CT (92.9%) with a small LE (7.1%) component,
  shifts to the hybridized local charge-transfer (HLCT) state of dTC-BPSAF, where
  the CT component is reduced to 56.3%, and the LE component increases to 43.7%. More
  importantly, the LE character of the BP acceptor (LE_A) increases significantly
  from 5.3% in BPSAF to 21.6% in dTC-BPSAF. These results suggest that the acceptor
  dendronization can significantly enhance the LE character in the acceptor. In comparison,
  donor-dendronized BPSAF-DCz exhibits CT characteristics in the T1 state with a small
  LE proportion of 4.67%, indicating that donor dendronization not only fails to increase
  the LE characteristics of BPSAF but also reduces them.


  Meanwhile, the hole−electron overlap in carbonyl oxygen (overlap(O)) also displays
  an obvious increase after acceptor dendronization, from 5.17% in BPSAF to 12.9%
  in dTC-BPSAF. Thanks to acceptor dendronization, carbonyl oxygen exhibits a large
  distribution degree of holes, originating from adjacent electron-donating carbazole
  dendritic structures. These results indicate that the acceptor dendronization strategy
  successfully enhances hole distributions in the acceptor and increases the 3 (n,
  π*) characteristics, which can substantially increase the SOC constants and facilitate
  triplet radiative transitions. On the contrary, the value of overlap(O) significantly
  decreases to as low as 0.32% in BPSAF-DCz, which is unfavorable for the n↔π transition
  and spin flip process. This decrease is because the donor-dendronized BPSAF-DCz
  enhances its electron-donating ability and weakens the hole distribution of the
  acceptor, leading to few 3 (n, π*) configurations and a low likelihood of emitting
  RTP. Consequently, the SOC (T1, S0) and μT d1→Sd0 of BPSAF increase significantly
  from 9.07 cm−1 and 4.29 × 10−8 D to 17.35 cm−1 and 1.03 × 10−5 D for dTC-BPSAF,
  indicating that dTC-BPSAF is expected to exhibit efficient RTP. In contrast, the
  SOC (T1, S0) is only 3.49 cm−1 and μT d1→Sd0 is only 1.2 × 10−8 D for BPSAF-DCz,
  suggesting that RTP is unlikely to be observed in BPSAF-DCz. These results indicate
  that, unlike donor dendronization, the acceptor dendronization strategy enables
  the dTC-BPSAF to exhibit greater LE characteristics and 3 (n, π*) configuration,
  thereby facilitating RTP emission.


  To explore the origin of the enhanced hole distribution in the T1 of the acceptor
  in dTC-BPSAF, we statistically analyzed the contributions of HOMOs to the hole in
  the T1 state of these compounds. For dTC-BPSAF, the HOMO contributes only 52.5%
  to the hole of the T1 state, with HOMO-21 and HOMO-10 accounting for 12.9 and 11.3%,
  respectively. In contrast, for BPSAF, HOMO contributes 95.9% while HOMO-6 contributes
  only 2.6% to the hole of the T1 state. Similarly, in the donor-dendronized BPSAF-DCz,
  HOMO contributes 93.9%, and HOMO-4 contributes 4.6% to the hole of T1 state. Meanwhile,
  the contributions of LUMO to the electron in the T1 state of dTC-BPSAF, BPSAF, and
  BPSAF-DCz are significant (>80%), indicating that the effect of electron changes
  on the LE and LE_A properties is relatively small. These results suggest that the
  donor dendronization strategy fails to generate more molecular orbitals for hole
  distributions of the carbonyl oxygen. In comparison, the acceptor dendronization
  effectively modulates the electronic structure of the T1 state, combining different
  mixtures of molecular orbitals to enhance the hole distributions in carbonyl oxygen
  and the 3 (n, π*) configuration of the triplet state. To investigate the universality
  of this acceptor dendronization strategy to achieve RTP, we conducted calculations
  on the excited states of small molecules BPSAX and BPSAT, and the corresponding
  dendrimers dTC-BPSAX and dTC-BPSAT. Our calculated findings reveal that acceptor
  dendronization can also lead to an increase in the ISC pathways, SOC (T1, S0), and
  μT d1→Sd0 for these dendrimers, and they are anticipated to exhibit efficient RTP.
  These calculated results support the universality of the acceptor dendronization
  strategy to achieve efficient RTP emission.

  ### Photoluminescence Behaviors in Solution

  <block id="4">

  To verify the feasibility of this acceptor dendronization strategy for achieving
  efficient RTP, the acceptor-dendronized dendrimer dTC-BPSAF was successfully synthesized.
  The ultraviolet−visible absorption spectrum in toluene solution reveals the presence
  of an intramolecular charge-transfer band spanning approximately 350−400 nm and
  the absorption bands at 350 nm can be assigned to the π−π* transitions of the dTC-BPSAF
  dendrimer. In the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum measured in toluene, dTC-BPSAF
  exhibits a sky-blue prompt emission peak centered at 494 nm. In the delayed PL spectrum
  with a delayed time of 0.1 ms, dTC-BPSAF exhibits a structureless emission at 497
  nm, suggesting that the long-lived emission spectra may originate from triplet states.
  The PL behaviors at room temperature are similar to those at a low temperature.
  The transient PL decay spectra of dTC-BPSAF and BPSAF in air-equilibrated toluene
  were measured for comparison. dTC-BPSAF displays a significant long-lived lifetime
  of 1.85 ms, but BPSAF shows a noticeably shorter delayed lifetime of 161 ns. The
  long lifetime of dTC-BPSAF is also demonstrated in different solvents. To determine
  the origin of the much longer lifetime due to acceptor dendronization, the temperature-dependent
  PL decay curves of dTC-BPSAF from 198 to 378 K were measured in air. The lifetimes
  of the long-lived components decrease monotonically with increasing temperature,
  which is opposite to TADF and consistent with phosphorescence. The fluorescence
  and delayed fluorescence with a short lifetime of dTC-BPSAF are also observed in
  toluene. To compare the air stability, the phosphorescence decay spectrum in nitrogen-filled
  toluene solution of dTC-BPSAF is measured and shows a lifetime (1.92 ms) similar
  to that in air, indicating that the RTP from dTC-BPSAF remains highly stable in
  solutions with and without oxygen. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
  measurements suggest that the triplet excitons generated by dTC-BPSAF exhibit low
  production of 1O2, which further illustrates the high stability of dTC-BPSAF against
  oxygen and triplet exciton quenching. These results demonstrated that acceptor dendronization
  can efficiently suppress phosphorescence quenching caused by oxygen in solution.


  The in-solution phosphorescence of dTC-BPSAF can be inferred to originate from inhibited
  molecular motion and suppressed nonradiative transitions. Generally, strong spatial
  (intermolecular and intramolecular) interactions can significantly rigidify molecular
  structures and limit molecular motion, which is beneficial to stable triplet exciton.
  In dilute solutions, the distance between two solute molecules is large, and intermolecular
  interactions can be ignored. Therefore, intramolecular interactions of the bulky
  dendrons after acceptor dendronization can be attributed to the main factors affecting
  the molecular motion of dTC-BPSAF. The intramolecular interactions (atomic distance
  d < 3.5 Å) of a single molecule can be estimated by calculating the number of through-space
  short contacts (TSSCs) of dTC-BPSAF based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
  using the GROMACS 2023.1 package. The average of TSSCs between the D-A core and
  dendrons for dTC-BPSAF is 34.4, and the value of BPSAF is only 4.25, indicating
  significantly increased intramolecular interactions due to acceptor dendronization.
  Therefore, the much greater intramolecular interactions of dTC-BPSAF effectively
  restrict molecular motion and stabilize the triplet excitons for emitting RTP in
  solution.


  Femtosecond transient absorption measurements were conducted to probe the energy
  dissipation process in dTC-BPSAF and BPSAF. Upon photoexcitation at 340 nm with
  a pump laser, there was a rapid increase in absorption in the excited-state absorption
  (ESA) spectrum, exhibiting an ESA peak at ∼600 nm. No apparent peak shift was observed
  in the ESA. The femtosecond transient absorption measurement of dTC-BPSAF exhibits
  two decay time constants, namely, 9.68 ps (derived from exciton−phonon coupling)
  and 631 ps (derived from energy dissipation pathway from molecular motion). For
  BPSAF, the two decay time constants are 0.44 and 14.8 ps. The longer decay lifetime
  of dTC-BPSAF is attributed to the slower singlet energy dissipation pathway due
  to the more crowded molecular structures. The bulky molecular structure enables
  dTC-BPSAF to convert absorbed photons into excitons, which can slowly undergo nonradiative
  recombination and inefficient energy transfer from dTC-BPSAF to the surrounding
  solvent through molecular motion. The singlet nonradiative decay rates were calculated
  using the Molecular Materials Property Prediction Package (MOMAP) software. The
  rate of acceptor-dendronized dTC-BPSAF (1.29 × 10^7 s−1) is much smaller than that
  of BPSAF (3.12 × 10^9 s−1), which is consistent with ESA dynamic results. These
  findings suggest that acceptor dendronization can effectively retard the energy
  dissipation process by restricting the structural motion.


  To further explore the effects of molecular motion and PL behavior, the average
  PL lifetimes of dTC-BPSAF and BPSAF in toluene at different temperatures are plotted.
  In low temperatures, both exhibit phosphorescence with long lifetimes due to the
  highly restricted molecular motion. As the temperature increases, molecular motion
  becomes more vigorous, and the PL lifetime of dTC-BPSAF gradually shortens to the
  submillisecond level, indicating that the dendritic structure with strong intramolecular
  interactions can greatly suppress triplet exciton quenching at high temperatures.
  In contrast, the PL lifetime of BPSAF with a flexible structure sharply decreases
  with heating, phosphorescence rapidly disappears, and only delayed fluorescence
  is displayed. These results suggest that intramolecular interactions can stabilize
  the triplet exciton by restricting molecular motion, resulting in significantly
  stable phosphorescence to counterbalance the exciton loss caused by molecular thermal
  motion.


  To directly demonstrate the molecular motion of dTC-BPSAF and BPSAF, we further
  employed variable temperature (VT) 1H NMR in dicloromethane-d2 to investigate their
  mobility. At 298 K, the 1H NMR spectrum of dTC-BPSAF, with bulky dendron substituents,
  exhibits three species in a range of 6.0−6.8 ppm with clearly broad spectra full-widths
  at half-maximum (fwhm’s) of 0.01 to 0.02 ppm, which are distinctively broader than
  those of BPSAF (0.06−0.09 ppm). This suggests that molecular rotation in dTC-BPSAF
  is significantly restricted at room temperature. At 223 K, the 1H NMR spectrum of
  dTC-BPSAF in a range of 6.5−6.8 ppm clearly shows three species and condensed broad
  peaks at 6.1−6.3 ppm. These fwhm’s of peaks of dTC-BPSAF (0.06−0.1 ppm) are significantly
  broader than those of BPSAF (0.01−0.02 ppm) at 223 K, indicating that acceptor dendronization
  more significantly suppresses molecular rotation at low temperatures.


  Furthermore, upon cooling, the triplet species of dTC-BPSAF at approximately 6.7
  ppm split into three peaks and undergo a significant upfield shift. The broad peaks
  at approximately 6.3 and 6.4 ppm also exhibit an upfield shift and coalesce into
  one species at 6.1−6.3 ppm. These upfield-shifted peaks at low temperatures are
  assigned to the more pronounced shielding effect of the electron cloud from nearby
  weak-donating dendrons due to intramolecular through-space interactions. Besides,
  the reduction of molecular motion at low temperatures can limit the rotation and
  vibration of the nuclei, thereby reducing the influence of local magnetic fields
  on the nuclei and causing upfield-shifted peaks. In contrast, compared with dTC-BPSAF,
  BPSAF displays very small upfield-shifted peaks upon cooling, indicating a smaller
  reduction in molecular motion and a weaker shielding effect due to the lack of intramolecular
  through-space interactions. These results demonstrate that acceptor dendronization
  significantly restricts molecular rotation and increases intramolecular through-space
  interactions.

  ### Photoluminescence Behaviors in the Aggregate State and OLED Devices

  <block id="5">

  To investigate the RTP properties from solution to aggregate states, the PL properties
  of dTC-BPSAF in a dilute THF/water solution were measured. The PL intensity of dTC-BPSAF
  exhibits a significant increase with the addition of water to fractions (fw) of
  90%, indicating a pronounced aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon. Concurrently,
  the phosphorescence lifetimes also exhibit a substantial increase from 3.2 to 28.0
  ms with an increasing degree of aggregation, indicating aggregation-induced phosphorescence
  enhancement (AIPE) behaviors. Therefore, the PLQY of dTC-BPSAF is 34% in solution
  and sharply increases to 63% in neat films. These results indicate that restricted
  intramolecular motion caused by aggregation can largely block the nonradiative pathways
  and further improve RTP efficiency.


  To fabricate the OLED devices, the PL properties of doped host films were investigated.
  Their prompt and delayed PL spectra of the doped host, 10-(4-((4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-phenyl)sulfonyl)phenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine
  (CzAcSF) at 10 wt % in films, exhibit PL emissions at 481 nm and phosphorescence
  emission at 483 nm for dTC-BPSAF, with a small ΔEST of 0.02 eV at room temperature.
  Moreover, the kISC of 2.07 × 10^7 s−1 for dTC-BPSAF in doped films is significantly
  higher than that of BPSAF (1.4 × 10^6 s−1), resulting in a high kP of 36.0 s−1 for
  dTC-BPSAF, which indicates the successful realization of efficient RTP emission
  in doped films through the acceptor dendronization strategy. Consequently, the PLQY
  of dTC-BPSAF doped film reaches up to 98%, highlighting their significant potential
  for the fabrication of efficient RTP-OLEDs.


  In the realm of RTP-OLEDs, several significant challenges persist, hindering their
  advancement. These obstacles include the low PLQY in amorphous films, inferior EQE
  of the devices, unstable electroluminescence spectra, and limited molecular design
  strategies. These factors collectively impede the development of efficient and color-stable
  RTP-OLEDs. Specifically, the development of high-efficiency sky-blue RTP materials
  has been fundamentally constrained by the large ΔEST in conventional systems, which
  induces significant emission redshift and compromises sky-blue emission purity.
  In this work, the RTP-OLED devices were fabricated by spin-coating and vacuum evaporation
  with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
  (PEDOT:PSS) (70 nm)/CzAcSF:dTC-BPSAF (90:10, EML, 40 nm)/bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]
  ether oxide (DPEPO) (10 nm)/1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-ylphenyl)benzene (TmPyPB) (50 nm)/lithium
  fluoride (LiF) (1 nm)/aluminum (Al) (100 nm). Among them, PEDOT:PSS and the emission
  layer were prepared by spin coating, while other layers were prepared by vacuum
  deposition. The fabricated devices exhibit sky-blue electroluminescence (EL) with
  a peak wavelength of 492 nm with CIE color coordinates of (0.18, 0.36). These values
  are slightly redshifted compared with the PL spectra in doped films. Notably, the
  EL spectra remained remarkably stable at different voltages, owing to the small
  ΔEST and near-complete overlap of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra. This
  innovative acceptor dendronization strategy overcomes the critical redshift limitation
  in conventional sky-blue RTP-OLEDs. The devices achieve a high maximum current efficiency
  (CE) of 59.5 cd/A, a maximum power efficiency (PE) of 33.9 lm/W, and a maximum EQE
  of 25.1%. These results exceed the current state-of-the-art performance for any
  reported solution-processed RTP-OLED devices. Considering that the light out-coupling
  efficiency of the conventional OLEDs is 20−30%, the abovementioned devices can achieve
  almost a unit exciton utilization rate. In addition, devices with different structures
  and comparisons indicate that the solution-processed TADF-OLED based on BPSAF exhibits
  an EQE of 22.4%, which is worse than the performance of RTP dendrimer devices. These
  results indicates that the acceptor dendronization strategy can not only transfer
  the luminescence mechanism from TADF to RTP but also increase the device efficiency
  due to the reduction of nonradiative transitions. Similarly, in their nondoped device,
  dTC-BPSAF also shows better efficiency. Hence, the acceptor dendronization design
  strategy exhibits the significant potential to enhance the efficiency of RTP-OLEDs.

  ## Conclusions

  <block id="6">

  By employing our developed acceptor dendronization strategy, we have successfully
  achieved a series of significant advancements: (i) we have proposed a clear design
  rule for RTP materials at the single-molecule level and thoroughly elucidated the
  mechanism from facilitating ISC, boosting triplet radiation to suppressing molecular
  motions to achieve efficient RTP; (ii) we have developed a new type of RTP material—RTP
  dendrimers—and provided a theoretical basis for the development of high-performance
  RTP dendrimers; (iii) we have simultaneously achieved ultrastable RTP with a lifetime
  of 1.55 ms in ambient solution, efficient RTP films with PLQY of 98%, and state-of-art
  solution-processed RTP-OLEDs with an EQEmax of 25.1%. This breakthrough was made
  possible by transforming small TADF molecules into RTP dendrimers through acceptor
  dendronization. First, the increased splitting of triplet energy levels generates
  more ISC channels and enhances the ISC process. Second, introducing electron-donating
  dendrons into the acceptor helps to increase hole distributions within the acceptor,
  leading to enhanced 3 LE A characteristics and 3 (n, π*) transitions and significantly
  boosting the SOC (T1, S0) and μT d1→Sd0. Third, the acceptor dendronization dendrimer
  exhibits multiple molecular interactions that construct a rigid dendronized structure,
  which restricts molecular motion and stabilized triplet excitons, leading to a reduction
  in nonradiative transitions. Therefore, these crucial advantages, originating from
  acceptor dendronization, collectively lead to efficient RTP emissions in both solution
  and solid states, providing clear guidance for molecular design in the RTP field.
  Consequently, our research contributes to a deep understanding of how to regulate
  excited state properties and molecular motion in molecular systems to achieve efficient
  RTP, opening new perspectives for the development of advanced materials in the field
  of optoelectronics.
