  ## INTRODUCTION

  <block id="1">

  Light is the source of life, which provides energy for all living organisms[1] and
  inspires scientists to explore photoresponsive materials for real-world applications.[2,3]
  Different from other commonly used stimuli such as force, pH, temperature, electricity,
  and polarity, light can be used as a remote and noninvasive trigger with high spatiotemporal
  resolution and without introducing additional reagents,4,5 making the photoresponsive
  materials excellent candidates for diverse advanced applications including as optoelectronic
  devices and in the biomedical field.[6−9] The photoacid generator is one of the
  most interesting photoresponsive materials with many potential applications such
  as in (bio)pattern generation, as an antimicrobial, and in tissue engineering.[10]
  Although a wide range of photoacid generators have been reported, there is still
  room for improvement. For example, some systems generate only weak acid,[11] some
  photoacid generating processes are invisible,[12] and previous reported photoacid
  generators are generally small molecules with poor processability,[13] all of which
  limit their applications.


  Among the photoresponsive materials, polymer-based materials show unusual advantages
  because of their good processability and film-forming ability. However, the research
  progress of photoresponsive polymers is unsatisfactory because of the synthetic
  difficulty. They are generally synthesized from photosensitive monomers,[14,15]
  which are carefully designed and expensive with limited variety. The lack of powerful
  polymerization methodology makes it difficult to incorporate diverse functional
  moieties into the polymer architecture and thus impede the development of photoresponsive
  polymers. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop facile polymerization methodologies
  for the in situ generation of photoresponsive polymers from simple starting materials.
  Moreover, the incorporation of fluorescent moieties, especially aggregation-induced
  emission (AIE) luminophores, into the photoresponsive polymers is anticipated to
  make the photoresponse processes visible and further expand their applications.


  Considering that the sulfonate ester group is photoresponsive,[16−19] polysulfonates
  could possibly undergo photodegradation readily with photoacid generation. Traditionally,
  polysulfonates are synthesized through interfacial polycondensations of aromatic
  sulfonyl chlorides and phenols. Unfortunately, this method is not suitable for multifarious
  monomers and the polymeric products obtained often show large polydispersity with
  low atom economy.[20,21]


  In 2017, Sharpless et al. reported an efficient sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx)
  click reaction for the synthesis of polysulfonates,[22−24] which is a big step forward
  and opens an avenue for the simple synthesis of polysulfonates.[25] However, a catalyst,
  expensive monomers, heating, dry conditions, and inert gas protection are required
  in the SuFEx reaction, and the atom economy still needs to be improved due to the
  release of bulky byproduct. Herein, we developed a catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization
  from the organic reaction of commercially available disulfonic acids and readily
  accessible dihaloalkynes[26] for the in situ generation of photoresponsive polysulfonates
  in excellent yields and high molecular weights. This catalyst-free polymerization
  was conducted at room temperature in air in a short reaction time with 100% atom
  economy. The resulting polysulfonates could undergo photodegradation accompanied
  by efficient photoacid generation and visible fluorescence change, which endowed
  them with multifunctionalities, including dual-emissive or 3D fluorescent photopatterning
  and broad-spectrum irreversible antibacterial activity. The halogen-rich polysulfonates
  exhibit a high and photoswitchable refractive index and could undergo efficient
  postfunctionalizations to further enrich the variety and functionality of photoresponsive
  heteroatom-containing polyesters.

  ## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

  <block id="2">


  </block>

  ### Polymerization

  <block id="3">

  Monomers used in this work are easily available. Disulfonic acids 2a−2c were purchased
  commercially, were inexpensive, and were used without further purification. Dihaloalkynes
  1a−1e were easily synthesized in high yields according to the previously reported
  procedures (Schemes S1 and S2).[27−30] All the polymerizations were conducted under
  air at room temperature in a one-pot catalyst-free manner without generating any
  byproduct.


  To obtain soluble polysulfonates in high yields with high molecular weights, we
  systematically investigated the polymerization conditions using 1a and 2a as monomers.
  The solvent, concentration, and reaction time were carefully investigated. The effect
  of solvent on the polymerization was first investigated. Dichloromethane (DCM) is
  a good solvent for haloalkynes but is a poor solvent for sulfonic acids, while hexafluoro-2-propanol
  (HFIP) is a good solvent for sulfonic acids because of the strong hydrogen bonding
  interaction[31] but is a poor solvent for haloalkynes. To achieve the best solving
  power for all monomers, HFIP/DCM mixtures with various volume fractions of HFIP
  and DCM were used for polymerization. The best polymerization result was obtained
  in HFIP/DCM (v/v, 1/8), which gave a polymer with a weight-average molecular weight
  (Mw) of 13 800 in 88% yield. A polymer with a higher molecular weight was obtained
  in a solvent mixture with a lesser HFIP fraction probably because it is a poor solvent
  for the resulting polymer. In addition, the monomer concentration also played a
  crucial role for the polymerization. When the monomer concentration of 1a was increased
  from 0.1 to 0.2 M, a polymer with a higher Mw was obtained in a higher yield. However,
  further increasing the concentration of 1a to 0.4 M led to a sharp decrease in both
  Mw and yield as the monomers were not completely dissolved. To reveal the kinetic
  of this polymerization, in situ IR spectroscopy was used to monitor the formation
  of polysulfonates. The reaction progress of monomers 1a and 2a was monitored in
  air at room temperature. It is obvious that two new peaks corresponding to C−O and
  C=C stretching vibrations emerged at ∼1391 and 1604 cm−1 in the spectra of the resulting
  polymer, and their intensity reached saturation within 2 h, suggesting the fast
  rate and high efficiency of this reaction. Thus, a time of 2 h was adopted as the
  optimal reaction time, since prolonging the reaction time to even 8 h did not lead
  to higher Mw and yield.


  Under the optimized polymerization conditions, different monomer combinations were
  employed to evaluate the robustness and universality of this polymerization route.
  Dihaloalkynes 1a−1c with different halogen atoms all reacted efficiently with 2a
  to afford polysulfonates in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The polymerizations
  also proceeded well for fluorene-substituted haloalkyne 1d and spirobifluorene-substituted
  haloalkyne 1e with large steric and 2a. Regarding the monomer scope of sulfonic
  acids, we found that all reacted efficiently with 1a to generate polysulfonates
  with excellent Mw in high yields, regardless of their rigidity, aromaticity, and
  bulkiness. All the obtained polysulfonates showed excellent solubility in commonly
  used organic solvents, such as DMF, DMSO, THF, DCM, and chloroform.

  ### Structural Characterization

  <block id="4">

  To gain insight into the structures of the halogen-rich polysulfonates, model compound
  3 was prepared by reaction of haloalkyne 1a and p-toluenesulfonic acid under the
  same synthetic conditions for the polymerization (Scheme S3). Typical FT-IR, 1H
  NMR, and 13C NMR spectra of polymer P1a/2a, model compound 3, and their corresponding
  monomers 1a and 2a are provided in Figure S1. The C≡C stretching vibrations of 1a
  and O−H stretching vibrations of 2a occurred at 2194 and 3442 cm−1, respectively.
  These peaks were not observed in the spectra of 3 and P1a/2a. Meanwhile, new peaks
  associated with C=C and C−O appeared at 1604 and 1391 cm−1, respectively, indicating
  the successful occurrence of the polymerization. Similar observations were also
  found in the FT-IR spectra of other polymers (Figures S2 and S3).


  The NMR spectra provided more detailed information about the polymer structures.
  The 1H NMR spectrum of P1a/2a displayed a new peak emerged at δ 6.47, corresponding
  to the vinyl proton at position “c”. The 13C NMR analysis further verified the polymer
  structure. The characteristic peaks of the C≡C resonances of 1a were not observed
  in the polymer spectrum. Instead, the carbon at position “c” resonated at δ 101.41.
  For all seven polysulfonates, the characteristic peaks of their vinyl protons absorbed
  at δ 6.30−6.75 and their 13C NMR spectra showed no C≡C carbon absorption peaks,
  confirming the successful synthesis of polymers with structures as shown in Figure
  1a (Figures S7−S20).


  </block>

  ### Polymerization Mechanism

  <block id="5">

  Based on the mechanism of small molecules,[26] we proposed a mechanism for the polymerization
  of disulfonic acids and dihaloalkynes (Scheme S4). The sulfonic acid could form
  hydrogen bonding with the typical hydrogen bonding donor HFIP (Figures S23 and S24).
  The formation of hydrogen bonding clusters not only increased the solubility of
  disulfonic acid monomers in the polymerization system but also increased the reactivity/acidity
  of sulfonic acid.[26,31] The first step of the polymerization was the proton transfer
  from disulfonic acid to dihaloalkyne, generating the vinyl carbocation intermediate.
  Then the intermediate underwent nucleophilic attack by disulfonic acid to form the
  alkenyl sulfonate moiety. These processes were repeated following the same addition
  mechanism, eventually forming the resulting polysulfonates.


  </block>

  ### Photophysical Properties

  <block id="6">

  The absorption and emission spectra of dilute THF solutions (40 μM) of the as-synthesized
  polysulfonates were shown in Figures S25 and S26. The emission of polysulfonates
  is easily tunable from 440 to 550 nm by polymerization using monomers with different
  electron density (Figure S26). By incorporating tetraphenylethylene (TPE) into the
  polysulfonate skeleton, the resulting polymers P1a−c/2a, P1a/2b, and P1a/2c showed
  aggregation-enhanced emission. Taking P1a/2a as an example, its DCM solution emitted
  weakly at 502 nm. Upon addition of a nonpolar poor solvent, such as hexane, the
  emission became stronger gradually, accompanied by a slight blue-shift in emission
  maximum to 487 nm (Figures S27 and S28).


  </block>

  ### Photodegradation and Photoacid Generation

  <block id="7">

  Some previous papers have reported that aryl sulfonate decomposes upon exposure
  to UV irradiation.[16,18,32] This inspired us to investigate whether the polysulfonates
  synthesized in this work could readily undergo photodegradation. White light irradiation
  (400−780 nm) of a THF solution of P1a/2a with an intensity of 500 mW/cm2 for 160
  min exerted no change on the molecular weight of the polymer, suggestive of its
  superhigh stability. In contrast, when exposed to the THF solution (1 mg/mL) of
  P1a/2a to 365 nm UV irradiation with an intensity of 40 mW/cm2 for 160 min, the
  Mn of the polymer gradually decreased from 12.1 to 1.9 kDa. The Mn of the P1a/2a
  film also decreased to 4.3 kDa under the same irradiation conditions. To our surprise,
  the photodegradation of the polymer could be accelerated in the presence of water.
  In a H2O/THF mixture (v/v, 1/99), the Mn of P1a/2a decreased to 4.4 kDa within only
  5 min and the polymer was completely degraded in 60 min. Dripping water on the P1a/2a
  film could also accelerate the photodegradation of the polymer.


  The “on-water” photodegradation effect is possibly related to the formation of sulfonic
  acid. To study the acid generation during the photodegradation of P1a/2a, a pH assay
  was conducted in a H2O/THF mixture (v/v, 1/99) of P1a/2a using a pH meter for organic
  solvents equipped with a H+ ion sensitive glass electrode. The initial pH of the
  polymer solution was neutral and remained constant under strong white light irradiation
  (400−780 nm) with the intensity of 500 mW/cm2. However, the pH of the polymer solution
  showed a sharp decrease upon prolonged 365 nm UV irradiation with an intensity of
  40 mW/cm2 and decreased from 7.1 to 0.3 within 20 min, suggesting the formation
  of a strong acid. P1b−1e/2a could all undergo photodegradation with strong photoacid
  generation as efficiently as P1a/2a, indicating that the halogen-containing polysulfonates
  were highly sensitive to UV irradiation, and the R1 groups did not show obvious
  influence on the photodegradation rate.


  Interestingly, the photodegradation process could be visualized by naked eyes as
  the P1a/2a suspension in THF/H2O mixture (v/v, 1/99) underwent a significant change
  of the emission maximum value from 495 to 427 nm during the photodegradation. The
  large fluorescence color change is mainly due to the decrease of conjugation length.


  In 1998, Scaiano et al. studied the photodegradation mechanism of sulfonate esters
  systematically and demonstrated radical formation during degradation using transient
  spectra.[32] Based on the previous reported mechanism and our experimental results,
  we proposed a mechanism of photodegradation and photoacid generation. In the electron
  paramagnetic resonance experiment at room temperature, the powder of P1a/2a exhibited
  a radical signal (g-factor = 2.0039) under UV irradiation in comparison with the
  radical silence property of the pristine polymer powder in the dark (Figure S31).
  Thus, the photodegradation was possibly initiated by a photoinduced homolytic S−O
  scission to generate a radical pair. Then the escaped sulfonyl radical reacted with
  water to form the sulfonic acid product. This corresponds to the on-water effect
  of the photodegradation. The phenoxyl radical was probably transformed to vinyl
  alcohol and then underwent tautomerization to generate the α-haloacetophenone. To
  verify the proposed mechanism, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight
  (MALDI-TOF) spectrum of the photodegradation product of model compound 3 was measured,
  which demonstrated the formation of sulfonic acid product (Figure S32). In the time-dependent
  photodegradation 1H NMR experiment (Figure S33), a new peak emerged at δ 2.29 and
  generally increased after UV irradiation, corresponding to the methyl group of p-toluenesulfonic
  acid. In addition, the 1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR spectra of the degradation product
  also confirmed the disappearance of the C=C double bond and the formation of keto
  groups (Figures S33 and S34).

  ### Fluorescent Photopatterning and Light Refraction

  <block id="8">

  The generation of complex fluorescent patterns by photo-lithography technique is
  of great significance in terms of optical writing and reading, anticounterfeiting
  applications, and biological sensing systems.[33] Because of the excellent solubility
  and film-forming ability of the present polysulfonates, their uniform films without
  defects can be easily fabricated on silica wafers by a simple spin-coating technique.
  The photo-responsive behavior of the polysulfonates makes them excellent candidates
  for pattern generation. Under light irradiation from a mercury arc lamp (200−400
  nm) in air for 40 min through a photomask, the polymer first underwent photodegradation
  and then subsequent photo-oxidation. Fluorescence of the exposed regions was completely
  quenched due to the photo-oxidation of the chromophores,[34,35] while the emissive
  areas were protected by the mask and remained intact. Thus, two-dimensional fluorescent
  patterns were generated. Surprisingly, these patterns could also be clearly observed
  under room light. By changing the shape and scale of the photomask, a photopattern
  in microscale could also be generated with high resolution and sharp edges.


  The creation of highly ordered dual-emissive fluorescent patterns is meaningful
  but challenging. Previously reported methods either are time-consuming[36] or require
  mixtures of different fluorescent materials.[37,38] However, using only a single
  material for dual-emissive luminescent photopatterns is still rare. Considering
  that the fluorescence of P1a/2a blue-shifted under UV irradiation for a short time
  due to photodegradation and was photobleached under UV irradiation for long time,
  we tried to fabricate a dual-emissive fluorescent pattern using P1a/2a film. The
  polymer film was first irradiated with a mercury arc lamp (200−400 nm) through both
  photomask I and II for 40 min to induce photobleaching. Then mask I was removed
  and the film was further irradiated for 5 min through mask II to trigger photodegradation.
  As a result, a fluorescent “earth” picture with green and blue emission was finally
  generated.


  Nature is an expert in fabricating micro- or nano-three-dimensional (3D) ordered
  structures, such as the super-hydrophobic surface of the lotus leaf and the structural
  coloration of the insects and animals.[39−41] Thus, 3D ordered patterns have attracted
  considerable research interest due to their special functionalities.[42] As the
  polysulfonates are highly sensitive to UV irradiation, they are ideal materials
  for 3D fluorescent pattern fabrication. After the polymer film was irradiated with
  365 nm for 5 min through a heart-shaped mask, the irradiated part showed a blue-shifted
  fluorescence and remarkable change in the refractive index due to photodegradation.
  By dipping the film in methanol for a few seconds, the irradiated part was washed
  away completely because the irradiated polymers lost their mechanical property.
  The protected part, on the contrary, was intact. Finally, a 3D heart-shaped pattern
  was generated. By changing the scale and pattern of the photomask, a 3D fluorescent
  microarray could be fabricated in the same way. The 3D structure could be observed
  by slightly slanting the microarray under the bright field of the microscope. The
  height of the step was measured to be 75 nm by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
  facile, rapid, and precisely controllable fabrication of fluorescent 3D ordered
  structures demonstrated the promising future of polysulfonates in constructing biomimetic
  materials, functional interfaces, and cost-efficient photolithography materials.


  The photoresponse behavior of these polysulfonates encouraged us to further explore
  whether their refractions are photoswitchable. Their initial refractive index (n)
  values were first measured. By incorporating different monomers into the polymer
  backbone, the polysulfonates P1a−d/2a showed high refractive indices ranging from
  1.920 to 1.626 in the spectral range of 400−900 nm. It is worth noting that the
  n values of P1a/2a were 1.823 at 486.1 nm and 1.770 at 632.8 nm, which were higher
  than those of sapphire (1.776 at 486.1 nm and 1.766 at 632.8 nm) and much higher
  than those of commercially important optical polymers, such as polycarbonate (n486.1
  = 1.600 and n632.8 = 1.581) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (n486.1 = 1.497 and n632.8
  = 1.489).[43] The n values of P1a/2a decreased gradually with prolonged irradiation
  time and the n difference (Δn) at 632.8 nm before and after light irradiation with
  a mercury arc lamp (200−400 nm) for 40 min could be as large as 0.1. The excellent
  tunability of the film refractivity by UV irradiation enables these polymers to
  find promising applications in optical data storage devices, gradient-index optics,
  and integrated photonic technology.[44−48]

  ### Photoacid Generator for Broad-Spectrum Bacteria Killing

  <block id="9">

  Controllable broad-spectrum bactericides and antibiotics are invaluable for modern
  healthcare-associated infections.[49−53] The ability of generating strong photoacids
  of the polysulfonates motivates us to further explore their antibacterial performance
  as the pH value has a significant influence on the bacterial growth.[54]


  In a preliminary experiment, the UV-triggered pH change of a bacteria resuspension
  containing P1a/2a was investigated and the pH was found to decrease from 6.7 to
  2.3 after 365 nm UV irradiation for 30 min. It is worth noting that the pH change
  of P1a/2a in the bacteria resuspension was slower than that in the H2O/THF mixed
  solvent, presumably due to the buffer capacity of the bacterial cytosol. Excitingly,
  under natural light, P1a/2a showed no toxicity to all the three bacteria species
  even at a concentration of 2 mg/mL, which facilitated the controllable bacteria
  killing in ordinary circumstances. According to the preliminary experiments, 2 mg/mL
  P1a/2a solution and 30 min UV irradiation were adopted as experimental conditions
  in the subsequent experiments.


  By virtue of the photoacid generation ability and hypotoxicity of P1a/2a, the antimicrobial
  activities of P1a/2a were subsequently evaluated to representative pathogenic bacteria
  (Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa) by a traditional plate counting method. In the absence of P1a/2a, all
  three kinds of bacteria grew and reproduced smoothly on the agar plates in the dark
  or under UV irradiation. The dark toxicity of P1a/2a was inconspicuous on all bacteria.
  In the presence of both P1a/2a and UV irradiation, all three bacteria were killed
  effectively and no colony formation could be observed on the plates, implying the
  excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial effect of P1a/2a.


  To further confirm the bacteria killing effect of P1a/2a, we employed scanning electron
  microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the morphological
  changes of bacterial cells under P1a/2a treatment, with S. aureus, E. coli, and
  P. aeruginosa as representatives. Without P1a/2a or UV irradiation, all kinds of
  bacteria showed their regular shape with well-defined borders and cell walls. When
  E. coli and P. aeruginosa were treated with P1a/2a and UV irradiation, obvious cell
  deformation, broken cells with the leakage of intracellular contents, and cell fragments
  were observed. S. aureus treated by P1a/2a and UV irradiation, on the other hand,
  showed a rough surface and fissured cell wall.


  Furthermore, the bacteria treated by P1a/2a and UV irradiation did not grow any
  more on agar plate after incubation at 37 °C for 15 days, which demonstrated the
  100% irreversible bacteria killing effect of P1a/2a.


  The above data indicated that the as-synthesized polymers at high concentration
  showed not only low dark toxicity but also low toxicity under visible light. Such
  a behavior differs from that of other aggregation-induced emission antibacterial
  agents.[55] Moreover, the as-synthesized polymers could cause highly efficient irreversible
  destruction of various pathogenic bacteria under UV irradiation. These characteristics
  will benefit the application of controllable in vitro sterilization in ordinary
  circumstances. Hence, for proof of concept, two practical sterilization models were
  designed by using P1a/2a as an antibacterial coating or spray. In model I, the polymer
  film was first coated on the glass and S. aureus was then transplanted on the film.
  After 365 nm UV irradiation for 30 min, the bacteria were 100% killed under wet
  conditions where bacteria could germinate. In model II, the polymer suspension was
  sprayed on the glass slide covered with bacteria followed by 365 nm UV irradiation
  for 30 min. After plate cultivation, the bacteria were also found to be 100% killed.
  These two models demonstrated that the polysulfonates are promising and flexible
  antibacterial materials for different situations, such as the surface sterilization
  of commodities, resistance to corrosion caused by microorganisms on ships, and customized
  bacterial scaffolds.

  ### Postfunctionalization

  <block id="10">

  Postfunctionalization is a powerful tool to endow polymers with more sophisticated
  structures and tunable functionalities.[56−58] The vinyl bromine or vinyl iodine
  functionality of the halogen-rich polysulfonates enables them to undergo various
  postfunctionalization via efficient named organic reactions such as Suzuki coupling.
  To demonstrate such a possibility, we conducted the reaction of P1c/2a with boronic
  acid derivative 3a in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and K2CO3 to generate P1c/2a/3a
  with an Mw of 10 400 in a high yield of 79% and high conversion ratio of 88%. This
  suggested that P1c/2a could serve as a versatile platform for postfunctionalization
  to further enrich the variety and functionalities of the polysulfonates. After modification,
  the absorption maximum shifted from 340 to 350 nm while the emission maximum moved
  from 515 to 550 nm due to the extension of the conjugation. P1c/2a/3a could also
  undergo photodegradation, but the degradation rate of P1c/2a/3a was much slower
  compared with that of the pristine polymer P1c/2a, which is probably due to the
  large steric hindrance and less electron deficiency of the hexylbenzene group compared
  with the iodine atom.

  ## CONCLUSION

  <block id="11">

  In summary, we developed a catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization for the facile
  synthesis of photoresponsive halogen-rich polysulfonates in 100% atom economy. The
  polymerization proceeded efficiently at room temperature in air within a short reaction
  time, generating a series of main-chain polysulfonates in excellent yields (up to
  94%) and high molecular weights (up to 27 600) with a wide monomer scope and excellent
  solubility. Compared with traditional synthetic strategies of photoresponsive polymers,
  this new strategy did not require photosensitive monomers or strict synthetic conditions.
  The embedded halogen atoms enable them to undergo various efficient postfunctionalization
  reactions such as Suzuki coupling to further enrich the family of polysulfonates
  and endow them with advanced functionalities. These polysulfonates showed extraordinarily
  high and tunable refractive indices because of the halogen atoms and the sulfonate
  ester group. Notably, these photoresponsive polysulfonates could undergo photodegradation
  with remarkable fluorescence change and photoacid generation. Such a property allows
  the fabrication of 3D or dual-emissive photopatterns with only a single optical
  material. As strong photoacid generators, the polysulfonates could not only realize
  the UV-triggered, irreversible and broad-spectrum bacteria killing but also show
  hypotoxicity in high dosage or under natural light. P1a/2a was also demonstrated
  to be a highly efficient bactericide as an antibacterial layer or spray in two practical
  models. The catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization will provide new strategies
  for the facile synthesis of polysulfonates to greatly enrich the family of polyesters
  and photoresponsive materials. The profound investigation on the properties and
  the various applications of polysulfonates will also provide more prospects for
  their practical usages, such as for adjusting intracellular pH, controllable sterilization,
  biopattern fabrication, tissue engineering, surface modification, and photocatalysts.

  ### Polymer Synthesis

  <block id="13">

  Standard Schlenk technique was applied in all the polymerization reactions, and
  the synthetic procedure of P1a/2a is given as an example. To a 15 mL Schlenk tube
  were added 4,4′-biphenyldisulfonic acid 2a (0.1 mmol), dihaloalkyne 1a (0.1 mmol),
  and 0.5 mL of HFIP/DCM (v/v, 1:8). The solution turned dark immediately after the
  addition of HFIP. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h.
  Upon completion, the unreacted sulfonic acid monomer was washed by adding 30 mL
  of water, followed by extraction with DCM three times. Subsequently, the organic
  layer was collected and concentrated, the solution was added dropwise into 100 mL
  of hexane, and the precipitate was finally collected after filtration, washed with
  hexane, and dried under vacuum at room temperature to a constant weight.
