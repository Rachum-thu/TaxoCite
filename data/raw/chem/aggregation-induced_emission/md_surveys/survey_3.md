## 1. INTRODUCTION

Smart materials are new types of functional materials that can perceive external stimulations and then judge and respond appropriately by themselves. [1,2] They are one of the most important directions for the development of modern intelligent materials in the information age. [3] Although there is still no unified definition, smart materials are generally called responsive materials with the following characteristics: (1) perceptiveness, i.e., able to detect and recognize the intensity of external or internal stimuli, such as electricity, [4] light, [5] heat, [6] magnetism, [7] mechanical force, [8] solvent, [9] pH, [10] chemistry, [11] nuclear radiation, [12] etc., (2) targeted conversion, i.e., able to convert the input stimulus signal into the targeted output response signal through specific mechanisms/pathways, (3) responsiveness, i.e., capable of responding to stimuli through timely changes in physical/chemical properties. [13−15] Among all these stimuli, light is the most unique stimulus due to its special properties such as precise stimulation and response, remote nonintrusive control, and environmental friendliness. Photoresponsive materials undergo either a photochemical or photophysical mechanism to convert the light stimulation into a chemistry reaction, sound, light, heat, electricity, force, and other forms of energy. [5] They have been found in various applications such as photoresponsive chemosensors, [16] photo-patterning, [17] photodegradation, [18] photodynamic therapy, [19] photodriven desalination, [20] photothermal therapy, [21] and photoacoustic imaging. [22] The huge potential opportunity offered by photoresponsive polymers has created a significant increase in their research and practical applications by both scientists and technologists.

Most traditional photoresponsive materials exhibit light responsive properties only in solution. However, for practical applications, the materials are often utilized in the solid or aggregate state. [23−25] In the solid/aggregate state, the properties of a molecule are usually different from those in solution. For example, photoresponsive systems utilizing fluorescence as output signals are one of the most widely studied systems for their simple detection method, visible and timely response, and high sensitivity. In the aggregate state, these systems commonly suffer from lower/non fluorescence intensity and photobleaching caused by the aggregation-induced quenching (ACQ) effect, which strongly hinders their practical applications. [26−29] It is thus critical to develop new photoresponsive systems to address these problems in the aggregate state.

In 1853, George Stokes observed an unusual luminescence phenomenon in platinocyanides that was the exact opposite of ACQ. [30] However, this occasional phenomenon did not attract the attention of scientists until Tang and co-workers reported the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) of a silole derivative called 1-methyl-1,2,3,4,5-pentaphenylsilole in 2001. [31] AIE luminogens (AIEgens) are generally nonemissive or faintly emissive in a dilute solution but emit strong fluorescence in a concentrated solution or aggregate/solid state. So far, the most acceptable mechanism of the AIE phenomenon is the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). [32,33] According to the RIM mechanism, AIEgens are dissolved in solution as isolated molecules, which facilitates the intramolecular motions and dramatically consumes the excitation energy through nonradiative decay. In aggregates, the distance between molecules decreases sharply, and such a physical construct significantly restricts the intramolecular motions of AIEgens and allows the excited state to relax through the radiative decay pathways. The RIM mechanism has promoted the design and development of myriad AIEgens with diverse molecular structures and physicochemical properties. [34−41] The strong solid-state luminescence greatly promotes the practical applications of materials by enhancing the light conversion efficiency and sensitivity. The introduction of AIEgens with a signal amplifying effect into photoresponsive materials is thus conducive to the design of new sophisticated photoresponse systems with higher resolution, stronger response signal, and lower response threshold. [42,43]

Among the photoresponsive AIE systems, polymeric materials show excellent processability, impressive mechanical robustness, and high stability. [44] Compared with small molecular luminogens, photoresponsive polymers show the following advantages. First, the small molecular luminogens show poor processability, while the polymers generally show excellent processability and mechanical strength, making the photoresponsive AIE polymers more suitable for diverse applications. Second, the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions of AIE polymers endow them with synergistic effects, which endows them superior properties and performance, such as stronger reactive oxygen generation ability. [45] Third, conjugated polymers generally show higher absorptivity, better photostability, and larger Stokes shift due to highly delocalized π-conjugated backbones, which enables them to be a good candidate for photoacoustic imaging. Finally, the photoresponsive polymers show easier surface functionalization than small molecular luminogens, which makes them ideal materials for photocontrolled drug delivery, biomedical research, encapsulation of fluorescent nanoparticles, and so on. [46] The combination of the photoresponsive AIE feature with polymers can not only enrich the basic research of materials science but also create new materials for high-tech applications and thus have attracted wide attention in recent years. [47−49]

In this Review, we summarize the previous work systematically and look forward to the future development direction of this field. To offer readers a more comprehensive understanding, especially the structure−application relationship, we first summarized the current construction methods of photoresponsive AIE polymers, including chemical, supramolecular, and physical strategies. Then, on the basis of different light-responsive mechanisms, we further classified the existing photoresponsive AIE polymers into two main types, namely, photochemical responsive and photophysical responsive systems. In each section, we summarized the general working mechanisms and examples for specific applications. In the last part, we conclude this Review by discussing the challenges and offering several perspectives on future directions.

## 2. CONSTRUCTION OF PHOTORESPONSIVE AIE POLYMERS

The photoresponsive AIE polymers are generally constructed by incorporating AIEgens and photoresponsive units (PRUs) into the polymer structure. On the basis of the interaction between the functional group and the polymer structure, these photoresponsive AIE polymeric systems can be classified into chemical, supramolecular, or physical strategies. In chemical strategies, the AIEgens and PRUs are incorporated into the polymer backbone or side chain by covalent bonds. The copolymerizations of AIEgens with difunctional and monofunctional photoresponsive monomers are the most widely used approaches. The chemical linkage of photoresponsive units to AIE polymers via postmodification can also generate photoresponsive AIE polymers. In some cases, polymers with the AIE and photoresponsive effect can be in situ constructed from AIE/photoresponsive-inactive monomers. Besides covalent interactions, noncovalent interactions, such as host−guest interactions and hydrogen bonding, can also be used to synthesize photoresponsive polymers with the AIE effect. Meanwhile, the physical doping and encapsulation of photoresponsive AIEgens by preformed polymers are the most widely used and simple way to generate photoresponsive AIE polymers.

### 2.1. Chemical Strategies

Chemical strategies are frequently utilized for constructing photoresponsive AIE polymers [50] in which the AIE effect is mostly originated from the embedded AIE moieties such as tetraphenylethene (TPE) and triphenylamine. Some other photoresponsive systems show the AIE effect through nonconventional mechanisms such as through-space interactions. Although the synthetic process is sometimes tedious, the polymers obtained by chemical methods generally show better light sensitivity than physical strategies due to the even distribution of AIEgens and PRUs.

Through copolymerizations of difunctional AIE monomers and photoresponsive monomers, photoresponsive AIE polymers with functional groups along the polymer backbones could be synthesized. For example, Lin and co-workers synthesized a photoswitchable polymer via Cu(I)-catalyzed azide−alkyne click polymerization of diarylethene(DAE)-containing diynes and TPE-containing diazide. [51] In 2019, Tang and co-workers developed an efficient C−H-activated polyspiroannulation to transform the 2-naphthols and diynes into photoresponsive spiro-polymers. [52] In 2021, Tang and co-workers synthesized photoresponsive polysulfonates via catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization of easy-accessible disulfonic acids and dihaloalkynes at room temperature with 100% atom economy in high yields. [49] On the other hand, side-chain photoresponsive AIE polymers could be generated when monofunctional photoresponsive monomers and AIE monomers are used. Compared with the main-chain ones, the solubility of the side-chain polymers is tunable by deploying an amphiphilic polymer backbone. Thus, the side-chain photoresponsive polymers are more easily adapted to multistimuli-responsive materials. For example, in 2015, Akagi and co-workers designed and synthesized several types of aromatic π-conjugated polymers with photoswitchable emission by combining phenylene- and thienylene-based main chains with photochromic DAE side chains. [53] In 2020, Chen and co-workers developed a set of photoresponsive liquid crystalline polynorbornenes using an α-cyanostilbenic moiety as a side chain. [54] Lin and co-workers synthesized a side-chain polymer with a stimuli response to light, pH, temperature, and CN− via free radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide and TPE-spiropyran-containing monomers. [55]

Another way to generate photoresponsive AIE polymers is by postmodification of AIE polymers with PRUs. Postmodifications would be considered rudimentary and unviable in the past as they require special postmodified reactions with extraordinary high efficiency, and the patches generated along the polymer chain are hard to remove and purify. [56] With the development of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization and click chemistry in recent decades, the efficiency has been greatly improved and postmodification polymerization could been considered equally with direct polymerization. [57] Postmodifications are feasible approaches to generate photoresponsive AIE polymers via inducing a functional unit into the polymer precursor. In 2019, He and co-workers synthesized azo-caged AIE polymers by introducing 2-phenyl-azo-4,5-dicyanoimidazole groups into a TPE-based epoxy precursor polymer. [58] The postmodification on biobased polymers has a significant scope for the further development of photoresponsive polymers used in biosystems. [59,60] In 2020, Gu and co-workers constructed a type of polymeric fluorescent particles (PFPs), which could be linked with nature killer (NK) cells by a ring opening reaction with a high efficiency of about 92.7%. [61] In 2020, Tang and co-workers developed a novel photobiosynthesis system by linking AIEgen to chloroplast (cp) via metal-free click bioconjugation. [62] Although some postmodification reactions have been proven to be efficient, the postmodification conditions for different polymers and monomers still are required to be optimized to achieve the desired reaction efficiency.

Besides the above-mentioned chemical synthetic strategies, the in situ generation of photoresponsive AIE polymers via AIE and photoresponsive inactive monomers is novel and attractive. In 2019, Lin and co-workers synthesized a novel photoresponsive AIE amphiphilic copolymer P(EG4-a-NA-zoOMe) with azobenzene pendants via an azide−alkyne click reaction from non-AIE-active monomers. [64] Observably restricted, the intramolecular vibrational or torsional motions of azobenzene groups upon aggregation lead to a strong AIE effect. In 2020, Yu and co-workers successfully synthesized a photoresponsive, water-soluble, AIE-active, double-helical polymer via Passerini multicomponent polymerization-induced assembly. [63] This special photoresponsive polymer exhibits the AIE property via through-space interactions of pyridines. When the polymer was irradiated by visible light (452 nm), it degraded into small segments due to the cleavage of the contained photolabile α-acyloxyamide structure via a typical photoinduced electron-transfer process. This special synthetic method provides a novel approach for preparing advanced chiral materials with AIE and multiresponsive characters. Such in situ generation strategies do not require photosensitive or AIE-active monomers but are very challenging because they require delicately designed monomers and new polymerization methodologies.

### 2.2. Supramolecular Strategies

Supramolecular strategies are another important method for the construction of photoresponsive AIE polymers. Unlike the covalent methods, supramolecular strategies utilize noncovalent interactions to incorporate AIEgens and PRUs together under mild conditions. These interactions include host−guest interactions, [47] hydrogen bonding, [65] metal−ligand coordinate interactions, [66] van der Waals interactions, [67] and other weak interactions. [68,69] Due to the reversibility of these noncovalent interactions, the generated polymers exhibit dynamic properties such as reversible gel−sol and liquid crystal−isotropic transition, and thus, they are ideal candidates for practical applications including drug delivery, phototherapy, photography, paints/coatings, optical memories, and biosensors.

Among these noncovalent interactions, host−guest interactions are one of the most widely studied systems in photoresponsive polymers. Supramolecular photoresponsive AIE polymers based on host−guest interactions show not only various well-defined macromolecular architectures but also high reversibility by light irradiation. In 2016, Liu and co-workers reported a cross-linked supramolecular polymer constructed by a host−guest interaction of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), azobenzene derivative, and TPE moiety containing 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium dication (DMV2+). [70] The E-azobenzene was able to serve as a second guest for a CB[8]/(DMV2+) binary complex to form a new ternary complex, while the bent-shaped Z-azobenzene was not favorable for binding with CB[8]. This supramolecular polymer was disassociated upon light irradiation due to the photoisomerization of azobenzene. In 2016, Zhu et al. synthesized a light/pH-dual-responsive AIE supramolecular nanoparticle for gene delivery via host−guest recognition between an N,N-dimethylethylenediamine-functionalized β-cyclodextrin host and adamantane-modified dimethylamino-azobenzene guest. [71] In 2021, Liu and co-workers reported a photocontrolled light-harvesting supramolecular assembly with aggregation-induced excimer emission fabricated by polyanionic γ-cyclodextrin, pyrene derivative, Nile red, and DAE derivative. [72] The fluorescence of the supramolecular nanoparticles could be reversibly switched on/off by irradiation with UV or visible light due to the reversible ring opening−closing photoreaction of DAE.

The hydrogen bonding interaction is also commonly used in the construction of supramolecular polymers. Unlike the host−guest interactions, the polymers prepared by such interactions usually suffer from weak mechanical properties. Therefore, using covalent polymer as a backbone and hydrogen bond forming functional moieties as side chains is commonly used in synthesizing such polymers. In 2018, Chen et al. constructed a supramolecular side-chain polymer based on hydrogen bonding of poly(4-vinylpyridine) and a dendritic α-cyanostilbene derivative. [73] The obtained polymer exhibited multiple reversible photoresponse abilities, including structures, surface topographies, fluorescence intensity, and color. In 2018, Park and co-workers synthesized photoresponsive polymer gel by cross-linking difunctional α-cyanostilbene derivatives with poly(acrylic acid) via multi-hydrogen bonding interactions. [74] Upon UV irradiation, this polymer could transform from gel to sol and change its fluorescence color and intensity from strong green to weak blue. In 2019, Li et al. synthesized a visible light responsive AIE organogel and xerogel containing an anthracene-based acylhydrazone derivative. Upon the visible light irradiation, the organogel and xerogel exhibited gel−sol transition due to the cis−trans isomerization of the −C═N− bond. [75] In 2020, Jiang and co-workers designed and synthesized two benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide-based cyanostilbene derivatives with different cyano positions, namely, α-BTTPA and β-BTTPA, which could form well-organized one-dimensional photoresponsive self-assemblies (ribbons and fibers, respectively) via the synergistic effect of the hydrogen bonding interaction and π−π interaction. This work explained the relationship between the molecular structure and the transition of emission properties during the cis−trans photoisomerization process of cyanostilbene. [76]

The coordination interaction has been an efficient approach in supramolecular strategies for its high strength and directionality. Photoresponsive coordination polymers can be prepared through the rational design of ligands and the appropriate selection of metal. In 2019, Zhou and co-workers developed a new doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded visible-light-responsive Pt(IV) prodrug and TPE copolymer nanoparticles used in combination therapy. Light could activate the Pt(IV) prodrug into the active Pt(II) drug and release encapsulated DOX at the same time. [77] In 2020, Liu and co-workers developed a photoresponsive carrier-free hybrid nanosphere platform integrated Fe3+ AIE photosensor and a Bcl-2 inhibitor (sabutoclax) via coordination-driven self-assembly. [78] Under laser irradiation, Fe3+ could increase the intracellular O2 concentration via a Fenton reaction, which further improves the ROS generation efficiency and enhances the photodynamic therapy.

### 2.3. Physical Strategies

Besides the aforementioned strategies, photoresponsive AIE polymers can also be constructed by the physical combination of photoresponsive AIE small molecules with polymeric materials by either doping or encapsulation. Currently, the most common preparation methods include but are not limited to drop-casting, [79] spin-coating, [80] electrospinning, [81] microencapsulation, [82] and 3D and 4D printing. [83,84] Unlike the former strategies that require a high preparation cost and sophisticated synthetic route, AIE polymers prepared by physical strategies usually benefit from facile fabrication procedures, economical friendliness, and wide applications. Photoresponsive AIE small molecules commonly suffer from obstacles for practical applications such as poor mechanical strength, but such problems could be easily solved by combining these molecules with appropriate polymer materials. The photoresponsive AIE polymers constructed by physical methods are suitable for practical applications, such as solar-driven desalination, [85] photothermal fibers, [86] and photothermal therapy. [87] Due to the recent booming in AIE research, various AIEgens with photophysical responsive properties have been synthesized. Definitely, the combination of these AIEgens with optimal polymer matrixes can generate numerous valuable advanced materials and facilitate the development of smart materials.

## 3. PHOTOCHEMICAL RESPONSIVE SYSTEMS

Photochemical responsive systems are designed by photochemical reactions that could induce macroscopic property changes. When these materials are irradiated by light, they are excited from the ground state to the excited state. The excited states could induce chemical reactions in the materials themselves or the surrounding environment to trigger a photoresponse, such as photoisomerization, a ring opening−closing photoreaction, photolysis, and photosensitization. The photoisomerizable azobenzenes and α-cyanostilbenes are typical photoresponsive structures used in photoisomeric polymers, which could undergo gel-isotransformation and photochromic responsiveness induced by light. Spiropyran (SP) and diarylethene (DAE) derivatives are generally designed for photoresponsive chemosensors based on their facile ring opening−closing photoreactions. Unlike the above-mentioned examples, which produce structural changes in RPU per se, photosensitization is a type of chemical reaction occurring in the surrounding environment of the materials under light irradiation. Azonia aromatic heterocycles are typical structures of this photoreaction, and polymers containing these moieties can be applied in the biological field for their ability to generate reactive oxygen species efficiently. On the basis of the RIM mechanism, the nonradiative decay of the aggregated AIEgens is minimized, which saves energy for fluorescence and intersystem crossing. [88] The efficient luminescence in the aggregated state can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in practical applications, while the longer triplet lifetime could increase the efficiency for ROS generation in photodynamic therapy. Through the rational design of various RPUs, the resulting AIE polymers can be used in a variety of practical applications, such as chemosensors, photopatterning, photodegradation, and biological applications.

### 3.1. Chemosensors

Photoluminescence chemosensors have attracted a lot of attention due to their considerable advantages such as simplicity, convenience, and low cost of implementation. Sensitivity is an essential property of sensors, and SP has become a popular candidate in photoluminescence chemical sensors for their special reverse photoreaction with a high-contrast color change. On the other hand, the introduction of the AIE effect can significantly improve the emission intensity of photoluminescence materials. Therefore, chemosensors based on photoresponsive AIE polymers generally show higher sensitivity and a lower limit of detection (LOD).

Photoluminescence chemosensors working under the photochemical responsive mechanism are commonly designed by using a photoluminescence change caused by the result of the photostable PRUs with a specific chemical group. In 2020, Lin and co-workers reported a novel amphiphilic photoresponsive AIE polymer (2) by copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and the TPE−SP monomer. [55] Upon light irradiation, the structure of the polymer changes from 2 to 11 and the emission color changes from green (517 nm) to red (627 nm) due to the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). More interestingly, the CN− ion can react with the carbon atom (−C═N+) of merocyanine moieties to significantly interrupt the π-conjugation of 11 to restore the fluorescence color back to green by hindering the FRET process. This chemical sensor shows good detectability toward CN− in water with a very high selectivity and sensitivity (LOD = 0.26 μM) and is promising for further biologic detection.

### 3.2. Photopatterning

Photopatterning is a process in which the pattern on the template is transferred to the materials through a photochemical reaction. It plays an irreplaceable role in optoelectronics and has attracted a lot of attention for its significant accuracy compared to molding and printing. [96−98] Photopatterning not only greatly improves the precision of material surface modification but also extends the application of polymer materials to highly precise field-effect transistors, high-resolved flexible display devices, and highly sensitive wearable detection devices.

Photopatterning could be divided into rewritable and nonrewritable on the basis of the type of photochemical reactions. Rewritable photopatterning generally operates under reversible photochemical reactions such as photoisomerization and the ring opening−closing reaction. In 2017, Zhang and co-workers designed novel photoswitchable fluorescent polymer nanoparticles (PFPNs) via encapsulation of a hydrophobic AIEgen called 4-phenylenebis(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl) methanone (13) by an amphiphilic photochromic copolymer (14). [93] The UV light could switch the polymer structure from 14 to 15 and the fluorescence color from green to pink owing to the FRET process of 13 and MC groups of 15. The prepared PFPNs exhibit a high dual-color fluorescence contrast, fast photoresponsiveness, and long-term stability, which is a good candidate for rewritable photopatterning. The fluorescence pattern of the letter “AIE” was recorded upon UV (365 nm) excitation by covering with pattern A. Then, the letters could be erased with the UV light after the removal of pattern A. Similarly, visible light could also induce the recording/erasing process. Thus, a rewritable photopattern was achieved by alternate irradiation of a photomask by UV−visible light.

Nonrewritable photopatterning can be utilized not only in traditional photopattern applications such as information storage [52,99−101] but also in biosystems such as novel intravital 3D bioprinting, [102] which attracts significant attention from various disciplines. In 2021, Tang and co-workers developed a catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization for the in situ generation of photoresponsive polysulfonates 16 at room temperature in air with 100% atom economy in high yields using easily accessible disulfonic acids and dihaloalkynes. [49] Compared with traditional synthetic strategies, this new strategy did not require photosensitive monomers or strict synthetic conditions. The photoresponsive fluorescence of the resulting polysulfonates was profoundly studied and explored for multiple applications. The detailed mechanism study shows that strong photoacid generation and photodegradation occur in the polymers upon UV irradiation. Such unique photoresponsive behaviors have been well utilized in highly ordered dual-emissive and 3D fluorescent photopatterning as well as the phototunable refractive index using a single material in a short time. Furthermore, as strong photoacid generators, the polysulfonates could not only realize the UV-triggered irreversible broad-spectrum in vitro sterilization but also show hypotoxicity in high dosage or under visible light. Besides, the halogen-containing polysulfonates could undergo efficient postfunctionalization to further expand the variety and functionality of photoresponsive polyesters.

### 3.3. Photodynamic Therapy

Photodynamic therapy has attracted great interest in multidisciplinary research areas owing to its significant status in modern precision medicine for its well-established, photocontrolled precision treatment. Generally speaking, the light-excited photoresponsive materials undergo an intersystem crossing (ISC) process, which transfers its energy to a highly sensitive T1 state from the S1 state. Then, the excited energy can be further transferred to the surrounding molecules such as oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are able to cause cell damage and apoptosis. [103−105]

In 2019, Tang and co-workers developed an efficient one-pot, charge-generating polymerization route to in situ generate functional azonia-containing polyelectrolytes 17−19 from readily accessible nonionic reactant and commercially available cheap ionic species. [95] The resulting polyelectrolytes possessed not only a rigid backbone with a strong donor−acceptor conjugated structure but also a reasonable conjugation length to trigger the ISC process. These features endow the polyelectrolytes with extraordinarily strong ROS generation ability and could impressively kill the drug resistant superbug. 17 was also demonstrated to effectively kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) both in vitro and in the MRSA-infected mouse burn model. The one-pot synthetic methodology for azonia-containing polyelectrolyte provides a new strategy for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes, enriches the family of functional polyelectrolytes, and offers enormous opportunities for further research on polyelectrolytes.

### 3.4. Controlled Drug Delivery

The light-controlled drug delivery is appealing for the precise release of drug at the pathological site to overcome the multidrug resistance and improve chemotherapy efficiency. In 2016, Liu and co-workers designed a novel nanoparticle (NP) for controlled drug delivery by self-assembly of doxorubicin (DOX) and a photoresponsive AIE polymer (20). [106] The amphiphilic polymer 20 were constructed by the conjugation of polyethylene glycol with an AIEgen through a ROS cleavable thioketal (TK) linker. The free DOX can be easily effluxed by the P-glycoprotein pump in drug-resistant cancer cells, but the controlled drug delivery system (20-NPs/DOX) could overcome the drug resistance and was endocytosed by the cancer cells and entrapped in endo/lysosomes. Upon white light irradiation, the generated ROS not only enhanced the membrane permeability of endolysosomes to facilitate the escape of NP to the cytosol but also broke the TK linker to lead to the disassembly of the NP. Consequently, DOX was released to the cytosol for nuclear entry to increase the drug retention in cancer cells. On the basis of the working mechanism, this photocontrolled drug delivery system can efficiently overcome the drug resistance in cancer cells and enables precise drug release in the pathological site.

### 3.5. Antitumor Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that boosts the natural defenses by helping the immune system to recognize, interfere, and destroy cancer cells and prevent metastasis. Compared with other treatments, immunotherapy could provide long-term immune memory to protect the treated mice from tumor cell rechallenge. Photoresponsive AIE polymers enable immunotherapy to operate in a precise and visionary way to monitor the treatment process. In 2020, Gu and co-workers constructed a type of polymeric fluorescent particles (PFPs) for light controlled antitumor immunotherapy. [61] These PFPs were synthesized via precipitation polymerization by mixing TPE-VBC (21), maleic anhydride (MAH), and styrene (St). The precipitation polymerization could be divided into three stages. In stage I, the fluorescence enhanced slowly with an increase in the particle size due to the loose packing of the polymer chain at the beginning of the polymerization process, which could not strongly restrict the intramolecular motions of 21. In stage II, the fluorescence intensity increased sharply as more 21 was copolymerized and deposited on the surface of the nuclei. In stage III, the fluorescence intensity increased slowly again, and even the particles grew bigger due to the limited amount of 21 in solution. The PFPs could be linked with natural killer (NK) cells by a ring opening reaction with a high labeling efficiency of about 92.7% within 1 h. Compared to NK cells, the PFP-coated NK cells exhibited the same capacity of inducing the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from MCF-7 cancerous cells in the absence of light irradiation, which demonstrated the good biocompatibility of PFPs. Upon light irradiation, the PFP-coated NK cells evoked more LDH release from the MCF-7 cancerous cells than the control group due to the ROS generated from 21 under light irradiation activated NK cells and promoted immunotherapy efficiency to cancer cells.

## 4. PHOTOPHYSICAL RESPONSIVE SYSTEMS

Photophysical responsive systems are designed by utilizing physical changes caused by different decay pathways after light excitation. Unlike the photochemical responsive systems, which are deactivated through photochemical reactions by partial photoenergy transfer to chemical energy, the photophysical responsive materials are deactivated via two different relaxation pathways, namely, radiative decay and nonradiative relaxation. The radiative decay of materials contribute to the fluorescence (FL), phosphorescence (PL), and photodynamic therapy (PDT), while the nonradiative decay could transfer the energy of light into heat by molecular vibration to evoke photothermal therapy (PTT) and a photoacoustic (PA) effect. Although these two decay pathways simultaneously existed and it was impossible to exclude any one completely, the corresponding macro-physical properties could be obtained through appropriate molecular design to favor a particular pathway. On the basis of this, photophysical responsive materials with either a FL/PDT or PA/PTT effect could be constructed. The PTT and PA effects can be applied in practical applications such as desalination and photothermal fiber. On the other hand, fluorescence can be changed to other forms of energy such as photobiosynthesis. Owing to the inherent rotor-rich structures of AIEgens, they have the potential for efficient photothermal and photoacoustic conversion and further enhance the photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging. [46] Meanwhile, the high quantum yield makes the AIEgens a powerful tool in improving photobiosynthesis efficiency by bioconjugation with chloroplasts.

### 4.1. Photothermal Therapy

The photothermal effect, which converts the absorbed light into localized heat via intramolecular movements and collisions with surrounding molecules, is the most widely studied photophysical response. Numerous practical applications such as solar-driven water evaporation, photothermal fiber, and PTT have been achieved on the basis of the photothermal effect. [108]

Solar-driven desalination is an effective method to address the serious water shortage by directly utilizing the photothermal effect. So far, various photothermal materials have been developed to convert solar light into heat, such as metal-based inorganic materials, carbon-based materials, and conjugated polymers. Compared with traditional photothermal materials, photothermal AIE materials are more ideal for desalination because the molecular rotors and/or vibrators in AIE moieties are favorable to boost the photothermal conversion efficiency. [109] In 2020, Gu and co-workers synthesized a photothermal molecule (7) containing AIEgens with broad absorption from 300 to 1600 nm upon aggregation. A photophysical responsive polymer (PU-7) was further constructed by doping molecule 7 into polyurethane (PU). Compared to the pure colorless PU, the brownish-black PU-7 owned a much rougher surface, which indicated 7 was doped in PU as small aggregates. Such aggregates enhanced the sunlight harvesting ability of PU-7 because its absorption was more fit to the solar spectral irradiance. The enhanced sunlight harvesting enabled the doped materials to show better solar−heat conversion and heat up to 77 °C, which was much higher than PU (30 °C) under the same condition. On the basis of the better solar−heat conversion of PU-7, a solar-driven water evaporation system was built for further particle applications. Putting the heating process of water under sunlight irradiation, the surface temperature of PU-7 foam floating on the water was 10 °C higher than pure PU. The efficiency of solar-driven water evaporation of PU-7 was calculated to be 87.2%, which evidently demonstrated that molecule 7 could greatly accelerate the solar−heat conversion.

The induction of functional molecules with a photothermal effect into hybrid nanofibers can lead to various applications such as solar steam generation, smart clothing, and thermal management. In 2020, Wang and co-workers constructed a core−shell fiber with a high efficiency of solar−heat conversion by coaxial electrospinning of molecule 9 and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene). [86] The photothermal nanofiber could be heated to 56.1 °C with 1 sun irradiation. Meanwhile, the fiber showed an obvious temperature change even after 9 rounds of irradiation, which indicated the high stability of solar heat conversion. The high efficiency and stability of the heat generation made the materials good candidates for photothermal patches and clothing. A core−shell fibrous patch was further constructed from photothermal fibers. After irradiation of natural sunlight for 1 min, the temperature of the patch was heated to 51.2 °C. This photothermal patch could also be heated to 24 °C under natural light irradiation in a 0 °C environment, indicating that this photothermal fiber could be used for outdoor clothing with the ability of keeping humans warm in a cold environment.

Besides the aforementioned applications, PTT is another application of the photothermal effect. PTT is a novel precise tumor treatment in modern medicine, which utilizes the local high temperature elevated by continuous-wave lasers to kill tumor cells. In 2019, Lu et al. constructed novel nanoparticles (NPs) by combining molecule 9 with human serum albumin (HSA) through van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions. [87] This material showed a better PTT effect toward mice bearing a CT26-Luc orthotopic tumor compared to conventional PTT medicine. Unlike phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and conventional PTT, the NPs not only offered a complete cure of cancer with the optimized laser doses but also ensured no recurrence in 30 days.

### 4.2. Photoacoustic Imaging

The photoacoustic (PA) effect is a follow-up phenomenon of the photothermal effect. When the excited materials undergo nonradiative decay, the molecular motion induces localized heat, which could further induce transient thermoelastic expansion and wideband acoustic waves/phonons. When the phonons are detected, PA imaging can provide 3D images of deeper tissues with enhanced signal contrast and high spatial resolution, which makes the PA imaging receive considerable attention in modern medicine and interdisciplinary studies. Among various PA imaging agents, nanoparticles containing organic π-conjugated molecules or polymers are more suitable for utilization in biosystems than their inorganic counterparts due to their good biocompatibility. In 2019, Tang and co-workers developed a highly efficient water-soluble photothermal nanoagent by doping the photothermal molecule (10) with a D−A structure into 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy-(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000). [110] This nanoagent owned an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 54.9%, which was much higher than currently available photothermal agents. This is due to the active excited-state intramolecular motion in aggregate, which induced the strong photothermal effect. The further live animal PA imaging experiment was conducted in the subcutaneous xenograft 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mouse model. The PA intensity at 4 h was around 2.7-fold higher than that at 0 h, which benefited from the excellent effect of the enhanced permeability retention and prominent PA effect.

### 4.3. Photobiosynthesis

Photobiosynthesis, in which carbon dioxide and water are converted into usable chemical energy under light irradiation in organisms, is one of the most important photoreactions in the world for sustaining planet life. Photosynthesis mainly occurs in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria that are rich in chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B. However, such a significant process suffers from incomplete usage of solar energy due to the partial match between the solar radiation spectrum and the absorption profile of chloroplasts. Chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B can efficiently absorb blue and red light but hardly capture light at less than 350 nm. Therefore, the conversion of light with wavelengths of less than 350 nm into blue or red light can effectively increase the utilization of light by chloroplasts to enhance photosynthesis. AIEgens have become good candidates for the enhancement of photobiosynthesis due to their efficient light emission in the solid state.

In 2020, Tang and co-workers developed a novel photobiosynthesis system by linking AIEgen (22) to chloroplast (cp) via metal-free click bioconjugation. [62] 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) was chosen to verify the photosynthetic enhancement of 22-cp. As an artificial electron acceptor, DCPIP could trap the electrons generated from the process of water splitting and electron separation in photosystem II. Therefore, the reduction of DCPIP could evaluate the photosynthetic activity of 22-cp. Under the irradiation of 1 mW/cm2 visual light, 22-cp led to a more rapid decrease of the absorption of DCPIP than that of cp, and the gap between them could be further widened when the visual light intensity was increased from 1 to 2 mW/cm2. It was because 22-cp generated more electrons from water separation and distinctly accelerated the reduction of DCPIP under irradiation. Meanwhile, the stronger light irradiation could further promote the photosynthetic reaction rate. These results testified that AIEgen 22 improved photobiosynthesis by applying more usable energy for cp.

On the other hand, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is another important product in the photosynthetic system, and its amount change was further measured by the luciferin/luciferase assay. The results demonstrated that 22-cp could generate more ATP under visual irradiation. These results showed that 22 could improve the light absorption capability, energy trapping, and energy efficiency for the electron transfer of the per reaction center of cp. The bioconjugation strategy based on 22 can noticeably augment the photosynthesis of chloroplasts. The enhanced photobiosynthesis can be obtained in a cyanobacteria (cb) system by using AIEgens called 3-diphenylamino-6-(2-pyridinyl) phenyl-diphenyl-boron and 4-[(2,2-diﬂuoro-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4,2-oxadiazaborol-3-yliden e)methyl]-N,N-dimethylaniline. [111] The number of cb incubated in the medium with AIEgens was 5-fold higher than the control group after a 14 day culture due to the increased photosynthetic active radiation by AIEgens and the change of the cyanobacteria protein expression in photosynthesis and metabolism. This optical engineering provides a novel and promising way to develop algae and plant factories and solve the global challenges.

## 5. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

The introduction of AIEgens into photoresponsive materials has been found to greatly improve their photoresponsive performance and expand the scope of applications. The role of AIEgens in photoresponsive AIE polymers can be summarized as follows: (1) effectively solve the ACQ problem; (2) provide higher fluorescence intensity to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in practical applications; (3) introduce unique photophysical properties; (4) improve the efficiency of phototherapies (PDT/PTT). In this Review, we systematically summarized photoresponsive AIE polymers with an emphasis on their general construction strategies, responsive mechanisms, and applications. These polymers are generally constructed by linking AIEgens with photoresponsive units via chemical, supramolecular, and physical strategies. According to the working mechanisms, two main responsive systems, namely, photochemical and photophysical, are classified. The photoresponsive AIE polymers showed excellent performance in various applications such as chemosensors, photopatterning, photodegradation, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, photoacoustic imaging, and photobiosynthesis. All the achievements and advantages indicated the fascinating properties and bright future of photoresponsive AIE polymers.

Various photoresponsive AIE polymers with fascinating properties have been made to convert light into other energy forms. However, the research on these materials is still in the infant stage. We are convinced that further efforts in the following aspects will flourish the photoresponsive AIE polymers. First, despite numerous photoresponsive AIE polymers having been constructed via the above-mentioned strategies, the mainstreams of AIEgens used to construct polymers are TPE and TPA. Therefore, the incorporation of new AIEgens into photoresponsive AIE polymers can enrich structural diversity, properties, and applications of the resulting polymers. Besides pursuing new AIEgens, the exploration of efficient construction strategies will also promote the development of photoresponsive AIE polymers. Specifically, multicomponent polymerization has become one of the hottest research areas in recent years, as the incorporation of more components will enrich the structural and functional diversity. The development of new photoresponsive AIE polymers via supramolecular strategies is interesting for the special changes of physical topography and physical properties of these macromolecules. This additional response brings photoresponsive AIE polymers into practical self-circulating applications such as logic gate devices, microscopic mass transfer, and light-controlled nanochannels. Because of the boom of new material emerging platforms, more construction methods have been invented to construct these photoresponsive AIE polymers, such as the melt-processing method and 3D printing technology, which will greatly improve the physical strategies and convert photoresponsive AIEgens into polymer forms for further applications.

Second, the types of photochemical responsive systems are still very limited. Although more than 20 types of photochemical responsive units have been reported, less than half of them have been successfully used in the construction of photoresponsive AIE polymers. Therefore, the exploration of new photoresponsive units that operate in varied mechanisms, such as catalyst-free light-controlled cycloaddition, will greatly enrich the types and further improve the development of photochemical responsive systems. On the other hand, the improvement of the performance (such as low energy light excitation) of the existing systems is also an important aspect to promote the development of this field. Also, research on new light-stimulated chemical response mechanisms is crucial for the future of this field, such as the in situ generation of the photolabile structure, which endows the polymers with photodegradation properties.

Third, for photophysical responsive systems, many applications have been reported such as photothermal therapy, photoacoustic imaging, and photobiosynthesis. Almost all the photophysical responsive systems are designed with the nonradiative decay process of the excited state. Generally, fluorescence is not regarded as a light response behavior because it does not trigger photoinduced chemical/structural changes. However, if the fluorescence is further transferred to other energy forms such as electricity and bioenergy, the applications of the photoresponsive AIE polymers could be further expanded to more exciting areas. From this perspective, further research on the secondary utilization of fluorescence will greatly enrich the photophysical responsive applications such as phototransistors, photodetectors, and optical memories. At present, the applications of the photophysical responsive systems in the photothermal area are mature with numerous cases, which makes the study on the structure−activity relationship of these systems a potential future research direction for the long-term development of this field. Machine learning and artificial intelligence predictions of new structures will lead traditional materials research into a new era.

Finally, the AIEgen platform has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, indicating that AIEgens are good candidates for further particle applications in modern medicine. Thus, research on the biological safety of these materials is required to flourish them in the biological field. Systematic research on the biological safety and renal metabolic toxicity of these molecules is essential for the future development and possible industrialization of biological applications. Meanwhile, the use of fluorescence generated by a photophysical response to improve the light utilization efficiency of traditional light-conversion organisms and/or tissues also shows excellent application prospects. Studies have shown that linking AIEgens with chloroplasts can increase the utilization of solar light by chloroplasts and produce more ATP under the same conditions. New types of photophysical responsive materials that promote photosynthesis may be another possible solution to the world food crisis.

We believe that AIEgens will play vital roles in the exploration of novel photoresponsive polymers through integration with various construction strategies and cutting-edge techniques. We hope this Review will inspire more scientific researchers to engage in this area, which has a bright future, and altogether promote an understanding of the full potential and further development of photoresponsive AIE polymers for widespread applications.
