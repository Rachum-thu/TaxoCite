ABSTRACT: Photoresponsive polymers have attracted extensive
attention due to their tunable functionalities and advanced
applications; thus, it is signi ﬁcant to develop facile in situ synthesis
strategies, extend polymers family, and establish various applications
for photoresponsive polymers. Herein, we develop a catalyst-free
spontaneous polymerization of dihaloalkynes and disulfonic acids
without photosensitive monomers for the in situ synthesis of
photoresponsive polysulfonates at room temperature in air with
100% atom economy in high yields. The resulting polysulfonates
could undergo visible photodegradation with strong photoacid
generation, leading to various applications including dual-emissive or
3D photopatterning, and practical broad-spectrum antibacterial
activity. The halogen-rich polysulfonates also exhibit a high and
photoswitched refractive index and could undergo e ﬃ cient postfunctionalizations to further expand the variety and functionality of
photoresponsive heteroatom-containing polyesters.

■ INTRODUCTION
Light is the source of life, which provides energy for all living
organisms1 and inspires scientists to explore photoresponsive
materials for real-world applications. 2,3 Diﬀerent from other
commonly used stimuli such as force, pH, temperature,
electricity, and polarity, light can be used as a remote and
noninvasive trigger with high spatiotemporal resolution and
without introducing additional reagents,
4,5 making the photo-
responsive materials excellent candidates for diverse advanced
applications including as optoelectronic devices and in the
biomedical ﬁeld.
6−9 The photoacid generator is one of the
most interesting photoresponsive materials with many
potential applications such as in (bio)pattern generation, as
an antimicrobial, and in tissue engineering. 10 Although a wide
range of photoacid generators have been reported, there is still
room for improvement. For example, some systems generate
only weak acid,
11 some photoacid generating processes are
invisible,12 and previous reported photoacid generators are
generally small molecules with poor processability, 13 all of
which limit their applications.
Among the photoresponsive materials, polymer-based
materials show unusual advantages because of their good
processability and ﬁlm-forming ability. However, the research
progress of photoresponsive polymers is unsatisfactory because
of the synthetic di ﬃ culty. They are generally synthesized from
photosensitive monomers, 14,15 which are carefully designed
and expensive with limited variety. The lack of powerful
polymerization methodology makes it di ﬃ cult to incorporate
diverse functional moieties into the polymer architecture and
thus impede the development of photoresponsive polymers.
Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop facile polymer-
ization methodologies for the in situ generation of photo-
responsive polymers from simple starting materials. Moreover,
the incorporation of ﬂuorescent moieties, especially aggrega-
tion-induced emission (AIE) luminophores, into the photo-
responsive polymers is anticipated to make the photoresponse
processes visible and further expand their applications.
Considering that the sulfonate ester group is photorespon-
sive,
16−19 polysulfonates could possibly undergo photo-
degradation readily with photoacid generation. Traditionally,
polysulfonates are synthesized through interfacial polyconden-

sations of aromatic sulfonyl chlorides and phenols. Unfortu-
nately, this method is not suitable for multifarious monomers
and the polymeric products obtained often show large
polydispersity with low atom economy.
20,21
In 2017, Sharpless et al. reported an e ﬃ cient sulfur(VI)
ﬂuoride exchange (SuFEx) click reaction for the synthesis of
polysulfonates,22−24 which is a big step forward and opens an
avenue for the simple synthesis of polysulfonates. 25 However, a
catalyst, expensive monomers, heating, dry conditions, and
inert gas protection are required in the SuFEx reaction, and the
atom economy still needs to be improved due to the release of
bulky byproduct. Herein, we developed a catalyst-free
spontaneous polymerization from the organic reaction of
commercially available disulfonic acids and readily accessible
dihaloalkynes
26 for the in situ generation of photoresponsive
polysulfonates in excellent yields and high molecular weights
(Figure 1a). This catalyst-free polymerization was conducted at
room temperature in air in a short reaction time with 100%
atom economy. The resulting polysulfonates could undergo
photodegradation accompanied by e ﬃ cient photoacid gen-
eration and visible ﬂuorescence change, which endowed them
with multifunctionalities, including dual-emissive or 3D
ﬂuorescent photopatterning and broad-spectrum irreversible
antibacterial activity. The halogen-rich polysulfonates exhibit a
high and photoswitchable refractive index and could undergo
eﬃ cient postfunctionalizations to further enrich the variety and
functionality of photoresponsive heteroatom-containing poly-
esters.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Polymerization
Monomers used in this work are easily available. Disulfonic
acids 2a−2c were purchased commercially, were inexpensive,
and were used without further puri ﬁcation. Dihaloalkynes 1a−
1e were easily synthesized in high yields according to the
previously reported procedures ( Schemes S1 and S2 ).27−30 All
the polymerizations were conducted under air at room
temperature in a one-pot catalyst-free manner without
generating any byproduct.
To obtain soluble polysulfonates in high yields with high
molecular weights, we systematically investigated the polymer-
ization conditions using 1a and 2a as monomers. The solvent,
concentration, and reaction time were carefully investigated
(Table 1). The e ﬀect of solvent on the polymerization was ﬁrst
investigated (Table 1, entries 1 −3). Dichloromethane (DCM)
is a good solvent for haloalkynes but is a poor solvent for
sulfonic acids, while hexa ﬂuoro-2-propanol (HFIP) is a good
solvent for sulfonic acids because of the strong hydrogen
bonding interaction
31 but is a poor solvent for haloalkynes. To
achieve the best solving power for all monomers, HFIP/DCM
mixtures with various volume fractions of HFIP and DCM
were used for polymerization. As shown in Table 1 , the best
polymerization result was obtained in HFIP/DCM (v/v, 1/8),
which gave a polymer with a weight-average molecular weight
(M
w) of 13 800 in 88% yield (entry 3). A polymer with a
higher molecular weight was obtained in a solvent mixture with
a lesser HFIP fraction probably because it is a poor solvent for
the resulting polymer. In addition, the monomer concentration
(Table 1 , entries 3 −4) also played a crucial role for the
polymerization. When the monomer concentration of 1a was
increased from 0.1 to 0.2 M, a polymer with a higher M
w was
obtained in a higher yield (entry 4). However, further
increasing the concentration of 1a to 0.4 M led to a sharp
decrease in both M
w and yield as the monomers were not
completely dissolved. To reveal the kinetic of this polymer-
ization, in situ IR spectroscopy was used to monitor the
formation of polysulfonates. The reaction progress of
monomers 1a and 2a was monitored in air at room
temperature. It is obvious that two new peaks corresponding
to C −O and C C stretching vibrations emerged at ∼1391
and 1604 cm
−1 in the spectra of the resulting poymer ( Figure
1b and c), and their intensity reached saturation within 2 h,
suggesting the fast rate and high e ﬃ ciency of this reaction.
Thus, a time of 2 h was adopted as the optimal reaction time,
since prolonging the reaction time to even 8 h did not lead to
higher M
w and yield ( Table 1 , entries 4 −6).
Under the optimized polymerization conditions, di ﬀerent
monomer combinations were employed to evaluate the
robustness and universality of this polymerization route. As
shown in Table 1 , dihaloalkynes 1a−c with di ﬀerent halogen

atoms all reacted e ﬃ ciently with 2a to aﬀord polysulfonates in
excellent yields with high molecular weights (entries 4, 7, and
8). The polymerizations also proceeded well for ﬂuorene-
substituted haloalkyne 1d and spirobi ﬂuorene-substitued
haloalkyne 1e with large steric and 2a (entries 9 and 10).
Regarding the monomer scope of sulfonic acids, we found that
all reacted e ﬃ ciently with 1a to generate polysulfonates with
excellent Mw in high yields, regardless of their rigidity,
aromaticity, and bulkiness (entries 4, 11, and 12). All the
obtained polysulfonates show ed excellent solubility in
commonly used organic solvents, such as DMF, DMSO,
THF, DCM, and chloroform.
Structural Characterization
To gain insight into the structures of the halogen-rich
polysulfonates, model compound 3 was prepared by reaction
of haloalkyne 1a and p-toluenesulfonic acid under the same
synthetic conditions for the polymerization ( Scheme S3 ).
Typical FT-IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectra of polymer
P1a/2a, model compound 3, and their corresponding
monomers 1a and 2a are provided in Figure S1 . The C C
stretching vibrations of 1a and O −H stretching vibrations of
2a occurred at 2194 and 3442 cm −1, respectively. These peaks
were not observed in the spectra of 3 and P1a/2a. Meanwhile,
new peaks associated with C C and C −O appeared at 1604
and 1391 cm −1, respectively, indicating the successful
occurrence of the polymerization. Similar observations were
also found in the FT-IR spectra of other polymers ( Figures S2
and S3 ).
The NMR spectra provided more detailed information
about the polymer structures. The
1H NMR spectrum of P 1a/
2a displayed a new peak emerged at δ 6.47, corresponding to
the vinyl proton at position “c” (Figure 2 d). The 13C NMR
analysis further veri ﬁed the polymer structure ( Figure 2 e−h).
The characteristic peaks of the C C resonances of 1a were
not observed in the polymer spectrum. Instead, the carbon at
position “c” resonated at δ 101.41. For all seven polysulfonates,
the characteristic peaks of their vinyl protons absorbed at δ
6.30−6.75 and their 13C NMR spectra showed no C C
carbon absorption peaks, con ﬁrming the successful synthesis of
polymers with structures as shown in Figure 1 a( Figures S7 −
S20).
Polymerization Mechanism
Based on the mechanism of small molecules, 26 we proposed a
mechanism for the polymerization of disulfonic acids and
dihaloalkynes ( Scheme S4 ). The sulfonic acid could form
hydrogen bonding with the typical hydrogen bonding donor
HFIP ( Figures S23 and S24 ). The formation of hydrogen
bonding clusters not only increased the solubility of disulfonic
acid monomers in the polymerization system but also
increased the reactivity/acidity of sulfonic acid. 26,31 The ﬁrst
step of the polymerization was the proton transfer from
disulfonic acid to dihaloalkyne, generating the vinyl carboca-
tion intermediate. Then the intermediate underwent nucleo-
philic attack by disulfonic acid to form the alkenyl sulfonate
moiety. These processes were repeated following the same
addition mechanism, eventually forming the resulting poly-
sulfonates.
Photophysical Properties
The absorption and emission spectra of dilute THF solutions
(40 μM) of the as-synthesized polysulfonates were shown in
Figures S25 and S26 . The emission of polysulfonates is easily
tunable from 440 to 550 nm by polymerization using
monomers with di ﬀerent electron density ( Figure S26 ).
By incorporating tetraphenylethylene (TPE) into the
polysulfonate skeleton, the resulting polymers P 1a−c/2a,
P1a/2b, and P 1a/2c showed aggregation-enhanced emission.
Taking P 1a/2a as an example, its DCM solution emitted
weakly at 502 nm. Upon addition of a nonpolar poor solvent,
such as hexane, the emission became stronger gradually,

accompanied by a slight blue-shift in emission maximum to
487 nm ( Figures S27 and S28 ).
Photodegradation and Photoacid Generation
Some previous papers have reported that aryl sulfonate
decomposes upon exposure to UV irradiation. 16,18,32 This
inspired us to investigate whether the polysulfonates
synthesized in this work could readily undergo photo-
degradation. As shown in Figure 3 a, white light irradiation
(400−780 nm) of a THF solution of P 1a/2a with an intensity
of 500 mW/cm
2 for 160 min exerted no change on the
molecular weight of the polymer, suggestive of its superhigh
stability. In contrast, when exposed to the THF solution (1
mg/mL) of P1a/2a to 365 nm UV irradiation with an intensity
of 40 mW/cm
2 for 160 min, the Mn of the polymer gradually
decreased from 12.1 to 1.9 kDa. The Mn of the P 1a/2a ﬁlm
also decreased to 4.3 kDa under the same irradiation
conditions. To our surprise, the photodegradation of the
polymer could be accelerated in the presence of water. In a
H
2O/THF mixture (v/v, 1/99), the Mn of P 1a/2a decreased
to 4.4 kDa within only 5 min and the polymer was completely
degraded in 60 min. Dripping water on the P 1a/2a ﬁlm could
also accelerate the photodegradation of the polymer.
The “on-water” photodegradation e ﬀect is possibly related
to the formation of sulfonic acid. To study the acid generation
during the photodegradation of P 1a/2a, a pH assay was
conducted in a H
2O/THF mixture (v/v, 1/99) of P 1a/2a
(Figure 3 b) using a pH meter for organic solvents equipped
with a H + ion sensitive glass electrode. The initial pH of the
polymer solution was neutral and remained constant under
strong white light irradiation (400 −780 nm) with the intensity
of 500 mW/cm
2. However, the pH of the polymer solution
showed a sharp decrease upon prolonged 365 nm UV
irradiation with an intensity of 40 mW/cm
2 and decreased
from 7.1 to 0.3 within 20 min, suggesting the formation of a
strong acid. P 1b−1e/2a could all undergo photodegradation
with strong photoacid generation as e ﬃ ciently as P 1a/2a
(Figure S30 and Table S3 ), indicating that the halogen-
containing polyslfonates were highly sensitive to UV
irradiation, and the R
1 groups did not show obvious in ﬂuence
on the photodegradation rate.
Interestingly, the photodegradation process could be
visualized by naked eyes as the P 1a/2a suspension in THF/
H2O mixture (v/v, 1/99) underwent a signi ﬁcant change of the
emission maximum value from 495 to 427 nm during the
photodegradation ( Figure 3 ca n d Table S2 ). The large
ﬂuorescence color change is mainly due to the decrease of
conjugation length.
In 1998, Scaiano et al. studied the photodegradation
mechanism of sulfonate esters systematically and demonstrated
radical formation during degradation using transient spectra.
32
Based on the previous reported mechanism and our
experimental results, we proposed a mechanism of photo-
degradation and photoacid generation ( Figure 3 d). In the
electron paramagnetic resonance experiment at room temper-
ature, the powder of P 1a/2a exhibited a radical signal (g-factor
= 2.0039) under UV irradiation in comparison with the radical
silence property of the pristine polymer powder in the dark
(Figure S31 ). Thus, the photodegradation was possibly
initiated by a photoinduced homolytic S −O scission to
generate a radical pair. Then the escaped sulfonyl radical 5
reacted with water to form the sulfonic acid product 8. This
corresponds to the on-water e ﬀect of the photodegradation.
The phenoxyl radical 4 was probably transformed to vinyl
alcohol 6 and then underwent tautomerization to generate the
α-haloacetophenone 7. To verify the proposed mechanism,
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of- ﬂight
(MALDI-TOF) spectrum of the photodegradation product
of model compound 3 was measured, which demonstrated the
formation of sulfonic acid product ( Figure S32 ). In the time-
dependent photodegradation

S33), a new peak emerged at δ 2.29 and generally increased
after UV irradiation, corresponding to the methyl group of p-
toluenesulfonic acid. In addition, the 1H NMR spectra and 13C
NMR spectra of the degradation product also con ﬁrmed the
disappearance of the C C double bond and the formation of
keto groups ( Figures S33 and S34 ).
Fluorescent Photopatterning and Light Refraction
The generation of complex ﬂuorescent patterns by photo-
lithography technique is of great signi ﬁcance in terms of optical
writing and reading, anticounterfeiting applications, and
biological sensing systems. 33 Because of the excellent solubility
and ﬁlm-forming ability of the present polysulfonates, their
uniform ﬁlms without defects can be easily fabricated on silica
wafers by a simple spin-coating technique. The photo-
responsive behavior of the polysulfonates makes them excellent
candidates for pattern generation. As shown in Figure 4 a,
under light irradiation from a mercury arc lamp (200 −400 nm)
in air for 40 min through a photomask, the polymer ﬁrst
underwent photodegradation and then subsequent photo-
oxidation. Fluorescence of the exposed regions was completely
quenched due to the photo-oxidation of the chromo-
phores,
34,35 while the emissive areas were protected by the
mask and remained intact. Thus, two-dimensional ﬂuorescent
patterns were generated. Surprisingly, these patterns could also
be clearly observed under room light ( Figure 4a). By changing
the shape and scale of the photomask, a photopattern in
microscale could also be generated with high resolution and
sharp edges ( Figure 4 b).
The creation of highly ordered dual-emissive ﬂuorescent
patterns is meaningful but challenging. Previously reported
methods either are time-consuming
36 or require mixtures of
diﬀerent ﬂuorescent materials. 37,38 However, using only a
single material for dual-emissive luminescent photopatterns is
still rare. Considering that the ﬂuorescence of P 1a/2a blue-
shifted under UV irradiation for a short time due to
photodegradation and was photobleached under UV irradi-
ation for long time, we tried to fabricate a dual-emissive
ﬂuorescent pattern using P 1a/2a ﬁlm. The polymer ﬁlm was
ﬁrst irradiated with a mercury arc lamp (200 −400 nm)
through both photomask I and II for 40 min to induce
photobleaching. Then mask I was removed and the ﬁlm was
further irradiated for 5 min through mask II to trigger
photodegradation (Figure 4c). As a result, a ﬂuorescent “earth”
picture with green and blue emission was ﬁnally generated
(Figure 4 d).
Nature is an expert in fabricating micro- or nano-three-
dimensional (3D) ordered structures, such as the super-
hydrophobic surface of the lotus leaf and the structural
coloration of the insects and animals.
39−41 Thus, 3D ordered
patterns have attracted considerable research interest due to
their special functionalities.

sensitive to UV irradiation, they are ideal materials for 3D
ﬂuorescent pattern fabrication. As shown in Figure 4e, after the
polymer ﬁlm was irradiated with 365 nm for 5 min through a
heart-shaped mask, the irradiated part showed a blue-shifted
ﬂuorescence and remarkable change in the refractive index due
to photodegradation. By dipping the ﬁlm in methanol for a few
seconds, the irradiated part was washed away completely
because the irradiated polymers lost their mechanical property.
The protected part, on the contrary, was intact. Finally, a 3D
heart-shaped pattern was generated. By changing the scale and
pattern of the photomask, a 3D ﬂuorescent microarray could
be fabricated in the same way ( Figure 4 f). The 3D structure
could be observed by slightly slanting the microarray under the
bright ﬁeld of the microscope ( Figure 4f, right). The height of
the step was measured to be 75 nm by atomic force
microscopy (AFM, Figure 4 g). The facile, rapid, and precisely
controllable fabrication of ﬂuorescent 3D ordered structures
demonstrated the promising future of polysulfonates in
constructing biomimetic materials, functional interfaces, and
cost-eﬃ cient photolithography materials.
The photoresponse behavior of these polysulfonates
encouraged us to further explore whether their refractions
are photoswitchable. Their initial refractive index ( n) values
were ﬁrst measured ( Figure S35 and Table S4 ). By
incorporating di ﬀerent monomers into the polymer backbone,
the polysulfonates P 1a−d/2a showed high refractive indices
ranging from 1.920 to 1.626 in the spectral range of 400 −900
nm. It is worth noting that the n values of P 1a/2a were 1.823
at 486.1 nm and 1.770 at 632.8 nm, which were higher than
those of sapphire (1.776 at 486.1 nm and 1.766 at 632.8 nm)
and much higher than those of commercially important optical
polymers, such as polycarbonate ( n
486.1 = 1.600 and n632.8 =
1.581) and poly(methyl methacrylate) ( n486.1 = 1.497 and n632.8
= 1.489). 43 As shown in Figure 4 h and Table S5 , the n values
of P1a/2a decreased gradually with prolonged irradiation time
and the n diﬀerence ( Δn) at 632.8 nm before and after light
irradiation with a mercury arc lamp (200 −400 nm) for 40 min
could be as large as 0.1. The excellent tunability of the ﬁlm
refractivity by UV irradiation enables these polymers to ﬁnd
promising applications in optical data storage devices, gradient-
index optics, and integrated photonic technology.

Photoacid Generator for Broad-Spectrum Bacteria Killing
Controllable broad-spectrum bactericides and antibiotics are
invaluable for modern healthcare-associated infections. 49−53
The ability of generating strong photoacids of the polysulfo-
nates motivates us to further explore their antibacterial
performance as the pH value has a signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on
the bacterial growth.
54
In a preliminary experiment, the UV-triggered pH change of
a bacteria resuspension containing P 1a/2a was investigated
and the pH was found to decrease from 6.7 to 2.3 after 365 nm
UV irradiation for 30 min ( Figure S36). It is worth noting that
the pH change of P 1a/2a in the bacteria resuspension was
slower than that in the H
2O/THF mixed solvent ( Figure 3 b),
presumably due to the bu ﬀer capacity of the bacterial cytosol.
Excitingly, under natural light, P 1a/2a showed no toxicity to all
the three bacteria species even at a concentration of 2 mg/mL
(Figure S37), which facilitated the controllable bacteria killing
in ordinary circumstances. According to the preliminary
experiments ( Figure S36 −S38), 2 mg/mL P 1a/2a solution
and 30 min UV irradiation were adopted as experimental
conditions in the subsequent experiments.
By virtue of the photoacid generation ability and
hypotoxicity of P 1a/2a, the antimicrobial activities of P 1a/2a
were subsequently evaluated to representative pathogenic
bacteria (Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-
negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by a
traditional plate counting method. As shown in Figures 5a and
Figure 5. Controllable broad-spectrum bacteria killing by photoacid generator P 1a/2a. (a) Survival rates of E. coli, S. aureus (SA), and P. aeruginosa

S39, in the absence of P 1a/2a, all three kinds of bacteria grew
and reproduced smoothly on the agar plates in the dark or
under UV irradiation. The dark toxicity of P 1a/2a was
inconspicuous on all bacteria. In the presence of both P 1a/2a
and UV irradiation, all three bacteria were killed e ﬀectively and
no colony formation could be observed on the plates, implying
the excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial e ﬀect of P 1a/2a.
To further con ﬁrm the bacteria killing e ﬀect of P 1a/2a,w e
employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the
morphological changes of bacterial cells under P 1a/2a
treatment, with S. aureus , E. coli ,a n d P. aeruginosa as
representatives ( Figure 5 b and c). Without P 1a/2a or UV
irradiation, all kinds of bacteria showed their regular shape
with well-de ﬁned borders and cell walls. When E. coli and P.
aeruginosa were treated with P 1a/2a and UV irradiation,
obvious cell deformation, broken cells with the leakage of
intracellular contents, and cell fragments were observed. S.
aureus treated by P 1a/2a and UV irradiation on the other
hand, showed a rough surface and ﬁssured cell wall.
Furthermore, the bacteria treated by P 1a/2a and UV
irradiation did not grow any more on agar plate after
incubation at 37 °Cf o r1 5d a y s( Figure 5 d), which
demonstrated the 100% irreversible bacteria killing e ﬀect of
P1a/2a.
The above data indicated that the as-synthesized polymers at
high concentration showed not only low dark toxicity but also
low toxicity under visible light. Such a behavior di ﬀers from
that of other aggregation-ind uced emission antibacterial
agents.55 Moreover, the as-synthesized polymers could cause
highly e ﬃ cient irreversible destruction of various pathogenic
bacteria under UV irradiation. These characteristics will bene ﬁt
the application of controllable in vitro sterilization in ordinary
circumstances. Hence, for proof of concept, two practical
sterilization models were designed by using P 1a/2a as an
antibacterial coating or spray ( Figure 5 e). In model I, the
polymer ﬁlm was ﬁrst coated on the glass and S. aureus was
then transplanted on the ﬁlm. After 365 nm UV irradiation for
30 min, the bacteria were 100% killed under wet conditions
where bacteria could germinate ( Figures 5f and S40). In model
II, the polymer suspension was sprayed on the glass slide
covered with bacteria followed by 365 nm UV irradiation for
30 min. After plate cultivation, the bacteria were also found to
be 100% killed ( Figure 5 f). These two models demonstrated
that the polysulfonates are promising and ﬂexible antibacterial
materials for di ﬀerent situations, such as the surface
sterilization of commodities, resistance to corrosion caused
by microorganisms on ships, and customized bacterial
scaﬀolds.
Postfunctionalization
Postfunctionalization is a powerful tool to endow polymers
with more sophisticated structures and tunable function-
alities.
56−58 The vinyl bromine or vinyl iodine functionality of
the halogen-rich polysulfonates enables them to undergo
various postfunctionalization via e ﬃ cient named organic
reactions such as Suzuki coupling. To demonstrate such a
possibility, we conducted the reaction of P 1c/2a with boronic
acid derivative 3a in the presence of Pd(PPh
3)4 and K2CO3 to
generate P 1c/2a/3a with an Mw of 10 400 in a high yield of
79% and high conversion ratio of 88% ( Scheme 1 ). This
suggested that P 1c/2a could serve as a versatile platform for
postfunctionalization to further enrich the variety and
functionalities of the polysulfonates. After modi ﬁcation, the
absorption maximum shifted from 340 to 350 nm ( Figure S41)
while the emission maximum moved from 515 to 550 nm
(Figure S42) due to the extension of the conjugation. P 1c/2a/
3a could also undergo photodegradation ( Figures S43 and
S44), but the degradation rate of P 1c/2a/3a was much slower
compared with that of the pristine polymer P 1c/2a, which is
probably due to the large steric hindrance and less electron
deﬁciency of the hexylbenzene group compared with the
iodine atom.
■ CONCLUSION
In summary, we developed a catalyst-free spontaneous
polymerization for the facile synthesis of photoresponsive
halogen-rich polysulfonates in 100% atom economy. The
polymerization proceeded e ﬃ ciently at room temperature in
air within a short reaction time, generating a series of main-
chain polysulfonates in excellent yields (up to 94%) and high
molecular weights (up to 27 600) with a wide monomer scope
and excellent solubility. Compared with traditional synthetic
strategies of photoresponsive polymers, this new strategy did
not require photosensitive monomers or strict synthetic
conditions. The embedded halogen atoms enable them to
undergo various e ﬃ cient postfunctionalization reactions such
as Suzuki coupling to further enrich the family of
polysulfonates and endow them with advanced functionalities.
These polysulfonates showed extraordinarily high and tunable
refractive indices because of the halogen atoms and the
sulfonate ester group. Notably, these photoresponsive
polysulfonates could undergo photodegradation with remark-
able ﬂuorescence change and photoacid generation. Such a
property allows the fabrication of 3D or dual-emissive
photopatterns with only a single optical material. As strong
photoacid generators, the polysulfonates could not only realize
the UV-triggered, irreversible and broad-spectrum bacteria
killing but also show hypotoxicity in high dosage or under
natural light. P 1a/2a was also demonstrated to be a highly
eﬃ cient bactericide as an antibacterial layer or spray in two
practical models. The catalyst-free spontaneous polymerization
will provide new strategies for the facile synthesis of
polysulfonates to greatly enrich the family of polyesters and
photresponsive materials. The profound investigation on the
properties and the various applications of polysulfonates will
also provide more prospects for their practical usages, such as
for adjusting intracellular pH, controllable sterilization,
biopattern fabrication, tissue engineering, surface modi ﬁcation,
and photocatalysts.
■ EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Polymer Synthesis
Standard Schlenk technique was applied in all the polymerization
reactions, and the synthetic procedure of P 1a/2a (Table 1, entry 4) is
given as an example. To a 15 mL Schlenk tube were added 4,4 ′-
biphenyldisulfonic acid 2a (0.1 mmol), dihaloalkyne 1a (0.1 mmol),

and 0.5 mL of HFIP/DCM (v/v, 1:8). The solution turned dark
immediately after the addition of HFIP. The resulting solution was
stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Upon completion, the unreacted
sulfonic acid monomer was washed by adding 30 mL of water,
followed by extraction with DCM three times. Subsequently, the
organic layer was collected and concentrated, the solution was added
dropwise into 100 mL of hexane, and the precipitate was ﬁnally
collected after ﬁltration, washed with hexane, and dried under vacuum
at room temperature to a constant weight.
