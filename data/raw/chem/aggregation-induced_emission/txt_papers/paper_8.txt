ABSTRACT: The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
in triple-negative breast cancer could hinder the response to
thorough immunotherapy and diminish the antitumor efficacy.
Although the STING pathway emerges as a promising target to
remedy defects, uncertain drug delivery might lead to off-target
inflammatory reactions. Here, we manifest a novel phototheranostic
agent with an aggregation-induced emission property that guided
the pharmacological activation of a STING agonist for photo-
thermal immunotherapy to create an immunologically “hot” tumor.
A pyridinium rotor strategy is proposed to develop a positively
charged TBTP-Bz, which is stably coincorporated with a STING
agonist MSA-2 into thermal-responsive exosome-liposome hybrid
nanoparticles for tumor-targeting delivery. TBTP-Bz exhibits aggregation-enhanced NIR-II emission and a photoacoustic signal,
accomplishing real-time tumor tracking. Its photothermal stimulation induces immunogenic cancer cell death and promotes the
precise release of MSA-2, thus boosting STING activation and STING-mediated type I interferon production. Significantly, single-
dose photoimmunotherapy effectively suppresses abscopal tumor growth and provokes an immune memory effect to inhibit
postsurgical recurrent and rechallenged tumors. This demonstrates promising clinical potential for poorly immunogenic breast
cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Despite continuing improvement in clinical treatment modal-
ities including radiotherapy,

to
initially eliminate most breast cancers, patients with aggressive
subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) often
experience high rates of recurrence and metastasis, posing a
challenging issue of cancer-induced mortality.
5
In recent years,
cancer immunotherapy utilizing drugs to activate the
endogenous immune system, such as inducing immunogenic
cancer cell death (ICD) to elicit antitumor effect, has
demonstrated outstanding clinical efficacy and sustained
therapeutic outcomes across various cancer types.
6−10
However, TNBC could orchestrate immunosuppression in
the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to immune
evasion and weak therapeutic response.
11−13
Currently,
immunotherapy for immunologically cold tumors has been
challenging. Therefore, the key lies in selectively stimulating
the immune system while effectively preventing immune
escape.
14
The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an
intracellular signaling receptor that emerges as a critical
pathway for governing the innate antitumor immune
response.
15
STING pathway activation can induce type I
interferon (IFN) secretion and proinflammatory cytokine
expression to remodel the immunosuppressed TME.
16−19
It
has been documented that triggering STING in cancer cells
and specific immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) can
enhance the ability of DC to cross-present antigens to CD8
+
T
cells, which induces spontaneous tumor-specific T cell
production and boosts antitumor effects.
20,21
However, the
majority of developed cyclic dinucleotide-based drugs require
intratumoral injection, limiting their efficacy and potentially
leading to uncontrolled systemic spread and widespread
inflammatory reactions.
22,23
MSA-2 is a newly developed
non-nucleotide STING agonist.
24
While this agent has been
administered orally and intravenously in animal studies, its low
bioavailability and insufficient cytosolic entry may constrain its
antitumor effectiveness. Furthermore, reports suggest that

excessive STING activation in immune cells may result in T
cell death, promoting cancer cell survival and reinforcing an
immunosuppressive environment.
17,25,26
Therefore, precise
and gentle stimulation of the STING pathway in targeted
cells is crucial for this therapy.
Photothermal therapy (PTT), which sensitizes and kills
cancer cells by heat, has demonstrated the ability to activate
inflammation and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy,
garnering significant attention.
27−31
Organic fluorophore-based
photothermal agents have been extensively developed due to
their promise for imaging-guided therapies. Yet, the planar
structures of traditional fluorescent materials often result in
π−π stacking conformation and insufficient electron transition
in physiological environments, significantly compromising their
luminescence and photothermal conversion efficiency.
32,33
Of
note, the photothermal agent with aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) properties and intense fluorescence in the
second near-infrared region (NIR-II, 1000−1700 nm), as an
advanced conceptual visual theranostic platform, can effectively
avoid molecular stacking by incorporating molecules with
rotors and twisted structures.
34−36
Controlled molecular
rotation in their aggregated state enables the precise regulation
of fluorescent intensity and photothermal efficiency.
Based on the above-mentioned considerations, we aim to
design highly efficient AIE phototheranostic agents that could
enhance STING activation through molecular modulation. We
innovatively propose a pyridinium rotor strategy, where the
optimized molecular rotor is the N-substituent group of the
pyridinium structure. This strategy can simultaneously enhance
molecular rotation and intermolecular charge transfer, thus
balancing the energy consumption pathway in the aggregated
state. The optimized TBTP-Bz molecule exhibits efficient
photothermal conversion efficiency and aggregation-enhanced
NIR-II emission under 808 nm laser irradiation, enabling NIR-
II fluorescence imaging (FLI)/photoacoustic imaging (PAI)/
photothermal imaging (PTI)-guided PTT (Figures 1a and 2a).
At the same time, the precision of molecular targeting is crucial
to ensure efficient local heat-induced cancer cell ablation while
minimizing damage to normal tissues. Furthermore, enhancing
the internalization efficiency of nanomaterials plays a
significant role in promoting photothermal immunotherapy,
which enhances STING activation and antigen presenta-
tion.
37,38
In recent studies, researchers have utilized tumor-
derived exosomes to encapsulate or fuse with nanomaterials,
increasing the tumor-targeting ability and cellular internal-
ization rate of nanomedicine through surface topological
modifications.
39−41
Inspired by the intelligent process, a thermoresponsive
biomimetic nanoparticle is fabricated for precise drug delivery
and selectively leveraging innate antitumor immunity under
NIR laser stimulation. Specifically, we fused the temperature-
sensitive liposomal 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl-
choline (DPPC) and 4T1 cancer cell-derived exosomes that
entrap TBTP-Bz and MSA-2, forming what is termed AMFL
(Figure 1b). Upon accumulation and infiltration into the
tumor region facilitated by abundant tumor receptors on the
exosome surface, the AIE phototheranostic agent exhibits
intense NIR-II fluorescence, photoacoustic and photothermal
signals with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling real-time
tracking of the tumor site in the three modalities. The
photothermal effect based on the AIE phototheranostic agent
promotes the deformation of DPPC, leading to a controlled
release of MSA-2 for enhancing STING pathway activation in
cancer cells. Additionally, the ICD induced by the AIE
phototheranostic agent effectively triggers the release of
damage-associated molecular patterns, demonstrating a syner-
gistic enhancement with STING agonists, involving down-
stream immunostimulatory signal production and IFN
secretion. Further investigation reveals that the STING
signaling in DCs was cooperatively activated to elicit DC
maturation and anticancer T cell priming for robust adaptive
immune responses (Figure 1c). Consequently, TNBC
suppression, potent inhibition of distant tumors, and effective
resistance to postsurgical recurrent and rechallenged tumors
are clearly demonstrated in mice models. Hence, this study
highlights the potential of AIE-based PTT augmenting STING
agonist activation for the synergistic photothermal immuno-
therapy of TNBC.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Facilitation of Molecular Motion to Develop NIR-II
Emissive AIE Photothermal Agents. A series of molecules
with D−π−A-type structures were designed consisting of three
compositions: the methoxy triphenylamine and pyridine
moiety served as the electron donor (D) and the electron
acceptor (A), respectively. A low-bandgap benzo[1,2-c:4,5-
c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) acceptor and a π-conjugated thio-
phene ring with bulky alkyl chains were strategically integrated
as the extended π-bridge and intermolecular spacer. This
design aimed to fortify the D−A interaction and facilitate
intramolecular charge transfer, thereby reducing the electronic
bandgap and extending the wavelengths of absorption and
emission. In addition, the twisted conformation of triphenyl-

amine and the incorporated alkyl chains effectively deter
intermolecular π−π stacking, fostering a pronounced AIE effect
and heightened fluorescence in the aggregate state. A benzyl
group was added as a N-substituent of the pyridinium moiety,
creating an additional intermolecular space and enhancing
intramolecular motion. Consequently, TBTP-Bz with positive
charges was synthesized. TBTP and TBTP-COOH were
synthesized as controls (Figure 2a). All of the molecules were
synthesized in good yields, ranging from 75 to 86% (Scheme
S1), and their structures were fully characterized by NMR and
high-resolution mass spectroscopies (Figures S1−S6). The
optical properties of TBTP, TBTP-Bz, and TBTP-COOH
were investigated. The absorption spectrum of the molecules
peaked at 805−835 nm in the aggregate state (Figure S7). The
photoluminescence (PL) signals were detected within the
900−950 nm range, with a broad band spanning the NIR-II
region 1000−1550 nm. With NIR-I absorption and NIR-II
fluorescence, these molecules proved ideal for deep tissue
imaging with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The AIE character-
istics of TBTP, TBTP-Bz, and TBTP-COOH were validated in
different good/poor solvent mixtures. As depicted, TBTP,
TBTP-Bz, and TBTP-COOH exhibited weak emissions in
THF or DMF, yet showed intensified PL signals in 90 or 99%
of the poor solvent conditions (Figure S8). To preliminarily
assess their photothermal potential in physiological settings, an
808 nm laser was leveraged to align with their absorption peaks
with enhanced tissue penetration depth. Experiments demon-
strated that TBTP-Bz could attain temperatures of up to 72.9
°C after 6 min of laser irradiation with a concentration-
dependent and laser power-dependent effect (Figure S9a−c).
Notably, TBTP-Bz exhibited the highest photothermal
conversion efficiency of up to 58.5% among the three AIE
molecules (Figure S9). Furthermore, the photothermal
stability and resistance to photobleaching of TBTP-Bz
aggregates were confirmed through consistent temperature
maintenance over three cycles of on−off heating. The high
photothermal conversion efficiency of TBTP-Bz in its
aggregate state prompted further investigation into its
underlying mechanisms using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with the GROMACS 2020 package. To obtain
amorphous aggregates of the AIE molecules in physiological
environments, 40 molecules were randomly placed in a cubic
box for initial aggregation and then mixed with surrounding
water molecules (Figure S10a−c). Energy minimization using
the steepest descent algorithm was performed to relax the
system. The optimized snapshots of aggregates (Figure 2b)
were picked from the production simulation to show the
packing manner of the AIE molecules in the aggregate state,
and the innermost molecules were chosen to study the stacking
mode. TBTP-Bz exhibited the weakest intermolecular
interaction (−534.79 kJ/mol) compared to the others
(−592.93 and −589.45 kJ/mol). Among all kinds of
interactions, TBTP-Bz has a weak electrostatic interaction
that could be attributed to the electronic repulsion of the
positively charged pyridinium moiety. In comparison, the
−COOH group in TBTP-COOH counteracts some of the
repulsion effects from the positively charged group, showing a
smaller intermolecular space and larger van der Waals
interactions. Figure S10d−f depicts that TBTP-Bz exhibited
a loose packing as it shows a smaller atomic contact ratio
(84.9%) compared to the other molecules (92.0% for TBTP
and 87.3% for TBTP-COOH). Similarly, the optimized
ground-state and excited-state geometries of TBTP-Bz
calculated by the density functional theory method showed
an obvious dipole electrostatic distribution (Figure S11a−c).
TBTP-Bz displayed the highest zeta potential (62.0 mV)
among three molecules from dynamic light scattering (DLS)
(Figure S12), testifying to the results from MD that the

positively charged moiety of TBTP-Bz plays an important role
in its packing mode. Next, the single-molecule and aggregated
reorganization energies (λ), a quantitative analytical parameter
of intrinsic geometry change upon photoexcitation represent-
ing the contribution of intramolecular motion, were calculated
to evaluate the energy consumption from the excited state to
the ground state through nonradiative pathways (Figure S11).
TBTP-Bz single molecules and aggregates showed large total λ
values of 12,922 and 4152 cm
−1
, respectively, with a high
contribution of dihedral angle associated with molecular
motions (81.6% for the gas phase and 62.3% for the aggregate
state). The results from the calculation were in accordance
with the strong photothermal conversion efficiency of TBTP-
Bz from the experimental results. The nonradiative decay of
the excited state of TBTP-Bz can be triggered by the drastic
molecular motion of the large-sized and the electrostatic
repulsion of the positively charged pyridinium moiety, whereas
these interactions could significantly lose the molecular
packing and promote the balance of the radiative and
nonradiative decay (Figures 2c and S11c).
Fabrication and Characterization of a Hybrid Bio-
mimetic Liposomal System. To ensure drug delivery
efficiency and therapeutic effect, nanoparticles with balanced
tumor-targeting specificity, stimulus-responsive function, and
biological barrier penetration ability are desirable. Herein, an
exosome-liposome fusion strategy was used to encapsulate
TBTP-Bz and MSA-2, obtaining AMFL. The exosome−
liposome hybrid nanoparticles (FL) were fabricated via the
thin-film hydration method. The absorption and FTIR
spectrum of AMFL exhibited characteristic peaks correspond-
ing to TBTP-Bz and MSA-2, confirming the successful loading
of both molecules (Figures 3a and S13). Western blot (WB)
analysis revealed the presence of CD9 and CD63 proteins in
AMFL and exosome membranes (Figure S14). Since CD9 and
CD63 are characteristic surface proteins found on 4T1 cell-
derived exosomes, their expression in AMFL indicates the
successful integration of exosome membrane components,
imparting it with tumor-targeting capability. DLS measure-
ments demonstrated that the size and zeta potential of AMFL
remained consistent with those of liposomes, ensuring the
stability of the hybrid nanoparticles (Figures 3b,c and S15).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of AMFL
revealed spherical vesicles with a diameter of ∼80 nm (Figures
3d and S16). As depicted in Figure 3g, differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) analyses of DPPC and DPPC-exosome
fusion nanoparticles exhibited a distinct phase transition
process with a similar transition temperature of ∼41 °C,
indicative of a cooperative and reversible thermal-responsive
gel-to-fluid transition. Subsequently, the photothermal proper-
ties of AMFL and its capability for controlled drug release were
evaluated (Figures 3e−h and S17). Upon exposure to 808 nm
laser irradiation, AMFL nanoparticles in TEM images showed

an expanded and disintegrated morphology, which could be
attributed to the thermal-responsive nature of the liposomal
component under the photothermal effects of TBTP-Bz
(Figure 3h). In addition, the efficient release of MSA-2 was
realized under the photothermal effect of AMFL (Figure 3i,j).
Furthermore, confocal microscopy images demonstrated that
AMFL exhibited enhanced internalization by cancer cells
compared to AML, which contained only liposomes as
encapsulated materials, underscoring its potent and cancer
cell penetration ability (Figure S18).

In Vitro Anticancer Power with Enhanced STING
Pathway Activation. Leveraging the tumor-targeting capa-
bilities and photothermal-responsive drug release functionality,
the anticancer efficacy was assessed. First, preliminary studies
were performed to ensure the therapeutic potential of TBTP-
Bz over those of the other two molecules. The FL
encapsulating TBTP-Bz was designated as AFL, and the FL
encapsulating TBTP and TBTP-COOH were designated as
AFLa and AFLc, respectively. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-
8) cell viability assay and thermal imaging recording
demonstrated that TBTP-Bz has the highest phototoxicity
and in vivo photothermal effect in tumor-bearing mice
(Figures S19 and S20). Next, the in vitro efficacy of AMFL
was evaluated. AFL and the pure liposomes encapsulating both
TBTP-Bz and MSA-2 were designated as AML, as control
groups. The CCK-8 cell viability assay demonstrated that
AMFL exhibited negligible cytotoxicity toward 4T1 cells,
consistent with prior findings that MSA-2 does not induce
direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. AML displayed
moderate cytotoxicity under laser irradiation, with a cell
viability of 44.1% ± 4.4% even at high concentrations of
TBTP-Bz and MSA-2, possibly due to its inadequate cancer
cell internalization. Under NIR laser irradiation, AMFL and
AFL exhibited significantly enhanced cytotoxicity by killing
over 90% of the 4T1 cancer cells, showcasing the photothermal
properties of TBTP-Bz and efficient cellular delivery with FL

encapsulation (Figures 4a and S21). Subsequently, flow
cytometry was employed to evaluate the cell apoptosis ratio
by annexin V-FITC/PI staining (Figure 4e). The proportion of
apoptotic cells surged to 36.1% in the AMFL-treated groups
following laser irradiation, surpassing the control groups and
signifying the onset of proapoptotic processes. To elucidate the
mechanism behind the AMFL-mediated superior antitumor
efficacy, PTT-induced ICD, DC maturation, and relevant
immune markers were investigated. The typical characteristics
of ICD, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release,
calreticulin (CRT) translocation to the cell surface, and high
mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) expression, were first
examined (Figures 4b−d and S22b). These features facilitate
antigen uptake, processing, and presentation by DCs,
promoting cytotoxic T cell production. As shown in the
immunofluorescence staining images, intense fluorescence
signals of HMGB1 and CRT were detected in the AFL and
AMFL-treated groups under NIR laser irradiation. The level of
ATP in the tumors of the AMFL + NIR group exhibited a 5.7-
fold increase compared to PBS-treated controls, indicative of
ICD induction. After verifying the ICD-evoking ability of
AMFL, DC maturation was investigated (Figures S22c and 4i).
We treated 4T1 breast cancer cells in different groups and then
indirectly cocultured with murine bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs) via a Transwell system that allows
the transfer of hybrid nanoparticles to the BMDC. The
populations of matured DCs increased to 36.1 and 56.0% for
AFL + NIR and AMFL+NIR groups, respectively. In contrast,
no significant changes in matured DC populations (17.7%)
were noted in the AMFL group in the absence of laser
irradiation, indicating the limited impact of AMFL on inducing
DC maturation without an effective drug release. While ICD
induction has been reported to be a potentially promising
pathway for immunotherapy, immune escape poses a challenge
to its efficacy. To address this, MSA-2 in AMFL serves as the
STING-pathway activator to boost the antitumor immune
response. To further explore whether AMFL could activate the
STING pathway in cancer cells, the related signaling pathway
was analyzed. WB analysis confirmed heightened levels of
phosphorylated STING, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and
interferon regulatory factor 3 in AMFL and AMFL + NIR
groups compared to control groups that lack MSA-2 (AFL +
NIR group), indicating STING pathway activation (Figures 4f
and S22). Notably, the STING pathways were stimulated in
DCs. We extracted the supernatant of AMFL-treated 4T1
tumor cells post low-speed centrifugation and used it for
BMDC conditioning. WB results exhibited elevated expression
levels of key STING signaling components following AMFL
treatment, notably higher than the other groups (Figure 4f).
On the other hand, the efficient DC uptake of AMFL was
testified, providing the support that MSA-2 could deliver to
DC for STING activation (Figure S23). Additionally, the

STING signaling components in the AMFL+NIR group
promoted IFN-β and TNF-α production in 4T1 cells and
DCs, along with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines
IFN-γ and IL-6 (Figure 4g,h). This underscores AMFL’s ability
to dual-stimulate ICD and STING pathways, thus enhancing
DC maturation and its antigen-presenting power (Figure 4j).
Real-Time In Vivo Tumor Diagnosis via Multimodality
Imaging. To further validate the suitability of AMFL for in
vivo theranostics and investigate its potential for clinical
application, we assessed the tumor-targeting capability in 4T1-
bearing mice using multimodal imaging techniques (Figure
5a). Initially, AMFL solution was imaged to show concen-
tration-dependent NIR-II signals under 808 nm laser excitation
(Figure S24). Then it was intravenously administered to the
tumor-bearing mice, and tumor accumulation was monitored
through NIR-II FLI. As a control, AML that utilizes pure
liposomes as encapsulating materials was also injected under
the same conditions. The tumor structure was imaged with
1250 nm bypass at different time points. As shown in Figure
5b, a clear resolution of tumor features was observed with
gradually increased NIR-II fluorescence intensity in the AMFL
groups. The intensity reached the platform at 12 h post
injection and remained steady even at 24 h post injection,
indicating its long-term retention potential (Figure 5d). Longer
imaging wavelengths enhanced the spatial resolution of fine
structures of the tumor area by remarkably increasing the
signal-to-noise ratio. In comparison, mice treated with AML
displayed a much weaker NIR-II fluorescence signal in tumor
regions, indicating the effective tumor accumulation of AMFL.
Furthermore, in vivo biodistribution also showed similar
results that AMFL possessed higher tumor accumulation and
retentions (Figures S25 and S26).

venously injected AMFL into a mouse’s bloodstream, and its
angiography was recorded. The whole vessel network of the
mouse is clearly visualized in prone positions, providing more
accurate diagnostic information about early diseases (Figure
5c). Next, the in vivo PTT potential of AMFL was investigated
(Figure 5e). After intravenous injection of AMFL for 12 h, the
tumor temperatures of the mice were monitored over time
using IR thermography while being exposed to 808 nm laser
irradiation. Figure 5f demonstrates the obvious temperature
rise in AMFL-treated mice with a maximum temperature of
50.6 °C upon irradiation (0.5 W/cm
2
) for 5 min, while mice
receiving PBS showed negligible temperature elevation in the
same condition. Inspired by the promising photothermal effect,
the application of AMFL in PA imaging was studied. The
direct correlation observed between the PA intensity and the
concentration of the AMFL underscores the significant
potential in facilitating quantitative PA imaging (Figure 5g).
In vivo PA tumor imaging was conducted by intravenous
injection of AMFL into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Figure 5h
depicts the PA images of the tumor at different time points.
Intense PA signal was distinctly visible at the tumor site at 4 h
post injection and reached its peak around 12 h post injection,
mirroring the results obtained from NIR-II imaging (Figure
5i).
In Vivo Inhibition of TNBC, Suppression of Abscopal
Tumor, and Control of Postsurgical Recurrent and
Rechallenged Tumors. Posteriorly, we further used a
bilateral tumor mouse model to investigate the in vivo therapy
potential of AMFL as a photothermal-immunotherapeutic
trigger. The bilateral tumor model was established by injection
of 4T1 cells into the right and left flanks as the primary tumor
and distant tumor on day 0, respectively. Mice were randomly
assigned to five groups when the primary tumor reached ∼200
mm
3
: PBS + NIR, FL (unloaded exosome−liposome hybrid
nanoparticles), AML + NIR, AFL + NIR, AMFL, and AMFL +
NIR. The formulations were intravenously injected, and the
primary tumor was directly irradiated (808 nm, 0.5 W/cm
2
, 5
min) at 12 h post injection (Figure 6a). The evaluation results
of the tumors demonstrated that the AMFL+NIR treatment
exhibited effective suppression of primary tumors (Figures 6b,c
and S27a) and growth control of distant tumors with the
highest survival rate (Figure 6d−f). The body weight of the
mice in each group did not change significantly after
administration (Figure S27). Histological examination of
tumor slices stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed the
efficient destruction of tumor cells in both primary and distant
tumors, indicating an abscopal effect of AMFL (Figure 6g).
Furthermore, the immunofluorescence analysis of primary
tumor slices showed that the mice in AMFL and AMFL+NIR
groups have a high expression on p-TBK1 and p-IRF3,
indicating the STING activation due to the precise
accumulation of MSA-2 on tumors (Figures 7a and S28a,b).
Meanwhile, the secretion of STING-related cytokines such as
IFN-β, as well as proinflammatory cytokines involving IFN-γ,
TNF-α, and IL-6, were measured by ELISA and RT-qPCR,
showing a substantial increase in tumor tissues of the AMFL +
NIR group compared to the other groups, supporting the
STING pathway activation and the potential to convert the
“cold” tumor into a more sensitive “hot” tumor (Figures 7d−g
and S29). It is worth noting that the intravenously injected
pure MSA-2 drug in mice caused significantly higher secretion
levels of TNF-α and IFN-β compared to the same
concentration of MSA-2 in AMFL, which may lead to
unwanted systemic immunity. This indicates the importance
of the precise drug release of AMFL (Figure S30). Encouraged
by the in vivo therapeutic effect and STING activation, the
elevation of systemic immunity was evaluated. As shown in
Figures 7b and S31, the expression of mature DCs
(CD80
+
CD86
+
) in the lymph nodes and spleen was enhanced
by ∼2.6- and 2-fold after AMFL + NIR treatment in contrast
with the PBS + NIR groups (Figure S28d), along with CD8
+
T
cell activation in the lymph nodes (Figure S31). The frequency
of tumor-infiltrating CD8
+
T cells exhibited a remarkable rise
in distant tumor tissues in the AMFL + NIR groups,
confirming the induction of a robust immune response
(Figures 7c and S28c). Thus, the mechanism of the abscopal
effect can be revealed. Benefiting from the efficient tumor-
targeting ability and accumulation effects facilitated by the
exosome-liposome hybrid encapsulation, the PTT effect was
presented by TBTP-Bz under NIR laser irradiation. This
process assisted the infiltration of MSA-2 and the induction of
the STING pathway with cytokine secretion. The synergistic
therapeutic effect may contribute to DC maturation and
subsequent T cell activation in tumor tissues, thereby eliciting
an antitumor immune response.
To fully exploit the long-term protection effect of our
photothermal-immunotherapeutic trigger and assess its clinical
potential,
43−45
we established a recurrent and rechallenged
tumor model in mice (Figure S32a). Following the treatments
mentioned earlier, the primary tumor in the right hind leg of
the mice was surgically removed on day 4 and the mice were
subsequently rechallenged with secondary 4T1 tumors in the
left hind leg. The volumes of the recurrent and rechallenged
4T1 tumors were monitored at certain time intervals.
Assessment of tumor volume and weight revealed that
AMFL+NIR treatment effectively suppressed the malignant
growth of both recurrent and rechallenged tumors compared
to the other groups (Figures S32b−h and S33a), accompanied
by an increased secretion of pro-proinflammatory cytokines
such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, ultimately leading to improved
survival rates among tumor-bearing mice (Figure S32i−k). To
evaluate the long-term antitumor immune responses, we
examined the frequency of central memory T cells (TCM,
CD62L
+
CD44
+
) collected from mice treated with different
regimens (Figure S32l). The frequency of TCM cells
significantly rose in the AMFL + NIR group, with the
proportion of TCM cells being approximately 2-fold higher
than that in the control groups (Figure S33b). This suggests
that the functional TCM generated by the AMFL+NIR
treatment could provide substantial long-term protection
against tumor recurrence and rechallenge. In addition, the
TUNEL and H&E staining of tumor slices revealed extensive
cell damage in the post-treatment period, with the most severe
damage observed in the AMFL + NIR group (Figure S34).
In contrast, the other five control treatment groups exhibited
only partial cell damage in their respective tumor slices.
Following the treatments, the body weights of mice across all
groups remained stable for 21 days, and no significant
morphological changes were observed in the main organs
(heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney). Blood biochemical
analysis revealed excellent blood compatibility and the least
liver toxicity, with no discernible differences between the
groups, indicating that the formulated AMFL exhibited
minimal systemic toxicity during the treatment period (Figures
S35−S37). These findings underscore the favorable in vivo
biosafety profile of AMFL for cancer immunotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS
To this end, we have first proposed a pyridinium rotor strategy
to develop simple D−A-type AIE phototheranostic agents. By
functionalizing the N-substituents of pyridinium, the increased
molecular rotor in the molecules helps with skeleton distortion
and twisting. The resulting drastic intramolecular motions of
optimized molecules TBTP-Bz will dissipate parts of the
excited-state energy via nonradiative decay, leading to an
excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 58.5%. More
importantly, TBTP-Bz exhibits aggregation-induced NIR-II
fluorescence for highly sensitive NIR-II FLI-guided multimodal
tumor diagnosis and efficient phototherapy, which is suitable
for potentiating following cancer immunotherapy.
Here, we constructed thermosensitive cancer-targeting
AMFL by coating 4T1 TNBC cell exosome membranes and
temperature-responsive liposomal DPPC encapsulated with
TBTP-Bz and MSA-2. Equipped with specific receptors for
4T1 tumor, intravenously injected AMFL imaged the tumor
area via long-retention NIR-II fluorescent emission and
photothermal energy-derived PA signal. Upon the tumor-
killing photothermal effect generated by TBTP-Bz under 808
nm laser irradiation, the temperature elevation facilitates the
deformation of the AMFL and in situ drug release,
substantially improving favorable delivery efficiencies of
MSA-2 and its STING-stimulating activity on both cancer
cell and DCs, thus triggering immune responses to switch the
immunologically “cold” tumor to a more sensitive “hot” one.
The synergistic photothermal-immunotherapeutic effect was
verified through enhanced tumor regression, effective distant
tumor suppression, and significant inhibition of postsurgical
tumor recurrence and rechallenge. In summary, this thermor-
esponsive biomimicking nanomedicine operates precise PTT
with real-time NIR-II imaging modality, which potentiates
antitumor immune response by STING pathway activation for
poorly immunogenic tumor treatment.
