Patterns have been widely used in many 
fields due to their ability to capture unique 
information or encode for specific func-
tions. For example, olfactory patterns can 
be classified in terms of discrete neuronal 
network states;
[1] changes in atmospheric 
circulation patterns can contribute to 
extreme temperature trends;
[2] analysis 
of the spatial patterns of residual for -
ests can provide information relevant to 
global deforestation, [3] and mesoscopic 
spatiotemporal phase patterns have been 
correlated with the so-called beta ampli-
tude variations in neuronal local field 
potentials.
[4] Color-based patterns are of 
particular interest. They play a key role 
in selective colorimetric sensor arrays, 
including ones that have been used to 
detect various volatile organic chemicals 
or gases;
[5] website information can be 
stored in the form of colored patterns. [6] 
Moreover, pattern-based colored materials 
have found applications in other areas, 
including structure-based color printing,
[7] oligonucleotide 
arrays,[8] electroluminescent devices, [9] color vision mapping 
in the human retina, [10] computational modeling, [11] mem-
ristor networks,[12] and biological mimicry. [13] In many of these 
applications, new colored patterns had to be generated so as 
to realize new/different applications/functions. This is a chal-
lenge from a materials perspective since most systems produce 
patterns that are not interchangeable. A functional, materials-
based array system whose pattern can be changed through 
simple physical manipulation may allow for new advances in 
pattern-related research and applications. Here we describe 
such a system modeled after the Rubik’s Cube, a trademark of 
Rubik’s Brand Limited.
The Rubik’s Cube (RC)
[14,15] is a plastic toy that is usually 
made up of 27 small cubes arranged into a larger cube through 
mechanical locks, three cubes to an edge. Each of the six square 
faces of the larger cube is colored in one of six eye-catching 
colors—typically blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and white. 
Thus, the six color square faces of RC can act as different pat-
tern candidates. Each layer of an RC can be rotated in different 
directions, resulting in a rearrangement of the pattern on each 
face. Inspired by this unique aspect of the RC, we sought a 
chemical means for making an RC-like material wherein the 
patterns could be changed through simple physical manipu-
lation (Scheme 1). To mimic such a structure without relying 
The dynamic behavior of a macroscopic adhered hydrogel stabilized through 
controllable dynamic covalent interactions is reported. These interactions, 
involving the cross-linked formation of a hydrogel through reaction of a 
diacylhydrazine precursor with a tetraformyl partner, increase as a function 
of time. By using a contact time of 24 h and different compounds with 
recognized aggregation-induced emission features (AIEgens), it proves 
possible to create six laminated acylhydrazone hydrogels displaying different 
fluorescent colors. Blocks of these hydrogels are then adhered into a structure 
resembling a Rubik’s Cube, a trademark of Rubik’s Brand Limited, (RC) and 
allowed to anneal for 1 h. This produces a 3 × 3 × 3 block (RC) wherein the 
individual fluorescent gel blocks are loosely adhered to one another. As a 
consequence, the 1 × 3 × 3 layers making up the RC can be rotated either 
horizontally or vertically to produce new patterns. Ex situ modification of 
the RC or application of a chemical stimulus can be used to produce new 
color arrangements. The present RC structure highlights how the temporal 
features, strong versus weak adhesion, may be exploited to create smart 
macroscopic structures.

on mechanical links, we sought to exploit robust yet reversible 
dynamic interactions [16–29] between individual colored blocks 
so as to create an overall hydrogel-based RC-like structure 
(RC) (Scheme 2) that benefits from the special features of the 
constituent dynamic hydrogel material.
[30] In preparing such 
a structure, the design of the dynamic covalent interaction  
is very important. Overly strong dynamic covalent interactions 
between hydrogel building blocks will not enable the layers 
of the RC to be rotated relative to one another. Conversely, 
dynamic covalent interactions that are too weak will not allow 
for the formation of a structurally stable RC or its constituent 
building blocks. In principle, the judicial use of transient 
differences in hydrogel binding strength may permit both the 
relatively weak adhesion effects needed to endow an RC with 
flexibility while providing interactions that are strong enough 
to enforce its integrity. As detailed below, this design expecta-
tion has been realized. In particular, we show that a robust, yet 
dynamic multicolored, pattern-producing system may be pre-
pared from six hydrogel films containing different aggregation-
induced emission (AIE)
[31–34] dots and one hydrogel cube 
lacking an AIE moiety through macroscopic adhesion. The  
as-prepared hydrogel RC could then be further modified 
through both physical and chemical means.
As noted above and shown in Scheme 2, the hydrogel RC 
was formed using six AIE hydrogels (HG-1 to HG-6) and one 
hydrogel HG-0 without AIE dots (Scheme 2a). Hydrogel HG-0 
is a cube structure while the other AIE hydrogels (HG-1 to 
HG-6) are thin cuboids with different fluorescent colors. These

seven hydrogels were first macroscopically adhered into an 
integral cube hydrogel HG-C by exploiting interfacial dynamic 
covalent interactions. The resulting cubes were allowed to sit 
for 24 h (i.e., long-time adhesion), to enforce strong interfacial 
adhesion. Next, individual blocks of hydrogel HG-C itself were 
macroscopically adhered to produce the target RC, which was 
only allowed to set for roughly 1 h. This provides for only weak 
interfacial adhesion (cf. Figure 1).
Hydrogels HG-0 – HG-6 were produced from two polymers: 
acylhydrazine-terminated PEO (AH-PEO-AH) and tetraaldehyde-
terminated PEO (TAPEO) (Scheme 2b). The synthesis and char-
acterization of these two polymers, which have precedence in 
the literature,
[30,35–37] and the requisite AIEgens, also previously 
described,[38–40] are detailed in Figures S1–S18 (Supporting Infor-
mation). Their combination in the present context is, however, 
new. Thus, hydrogel HG-0 was formed by mixing these two poly-
mers in aqueous solution, while AIE hydrogels (HG-1 to HG-6) 
were produced by mixing the two polymers in aqueous suspen-
sions of AIE dots (Scheme 2b).
[41,42] Due to the presence of the 
AIEgens,[43–47] the six AIE hydrogels (HG-1 to HG-6) produce 
different fluorescent colors upon UV illumination (cf. Figure 2).
When these hydrogels are placed in contact, the acylhy-
drazone bonds of one hydrogel interact with those of another 
hydrogel.
[30,48,49] Over short times (e.g., 1 h) only a small per -
centage of the acylhydrazone bonds undergo exchange leading 
to a low level of stickiness. With increasing time, stronger 
interfacial interactions are expected. Support for this postulate 
came from studies
[37] wherein two HG-0 hydrogels of same 
weight were assembled and tested in a time-dependent manner  
(cf. Figure 1; Movie S1 and Figure S19, Supporting Information). 
Their tensile behavior was then investigated as a function of 
time (cf. Figure 1b; Movie S1 and Figure S19, Supporting Infor-
mation), with the corresponding adhesion time dependence 
of the fracture stress and fracture strain being summarized in 
Figure 1c. The results of this experiment provide support for the 
notion that increasing the block-to-block contact time from 1, 3, 
6, 12, 24 to 40 h leads to a monotonic increase in both the frac-
ture stress and fracture strain (Figure 2b,c). Initially, the mechan-
ical parameters increased quickly but then more slowly after 
≈24 h. Similar assembly features were seen for hydrogels HG-1 
to HG-6 (Figure S20, Supporting Information). These results 
are consistent with the structure-defining acylhydrazone bonds 
being spontaneously (re)formed in a time-dependent manner.
[37] 
In addition, on the basis of 1H NMR spectroscopic experi-
ments, the dynamics of the underlying covalent reaction could 
be evaluated in a semiquantitative manner (Figures S21–S24,  
Supporting Information). Rheology measurements also 
proved consistent with the expected time-dependent adhesion 
(Figures S25 and S26, Supporting Information). Additional sup-
port for the time-dependent adhesion behavior came from the 
associated modulus and toughness values (Figures S27 and S28, 
Supporting Information). With increasing of adhesion time, 
the adhered samples become increasingly robust. Thus, various 
mechanical parameters reflecting more fully integrated mate-
rials, including the modulus, breaking strain, breaking stress, 
and toughness, likewise increase with time.
To provide further support for the proposed temporal 
control over the adhesion process as a function of bonding 
between the surfaces, two gels, G-9 and G-10, were subject  
to an additional adhesion test (Scheme S1, Supporting

Information). The AIE-YG-containing gel G-9 gives rise 
to a bright fluorescence due to the AIE effect of the con-
stituent tetraphenylethene (TPE).
[33,34] In contrast, G-10 
lacks an AIEgen and displays little appreciable fluores-
cence. When these two gels were adhered together the TPE 
groups of G-9 at the surface, exchange into gel G-10 due to  
the dynamic nature of the acylhydrazone bonds present at 
the interfaces. This exchange converts the initially nonfluo-
rescent gel G-10 into a fluorescent material (Scheme S1, Sup-
porting Information). As the adhesion time increases, a greater 
number of acylhydrazone bonds exchange. The fluorescent 
emission intensity of gel G-10 thus likewise increases with time 
(Figures S29 and S30, Supporting Information). A series of 
gels with different AIE-YG concentrations was also prepared. 
These systems were used to confirm the expected relationship 
between gel fluorescent intensity and AIE-YG concentration 
(Figures S31 and S32, Supporting Information). This was taken 
as additional evidence that acylhydrazone bonds exchange at the 
interface and do so in a time-dependent manner (Figure S33, 
Supporting Information).
The above temporal features led us to consider that it might 
be possible to produce a functioning Rubik’s Cube (RC)-like 
structure (i.e., RC; Scheme 2).
To create an RC mimic using soft materials, we first pre-
pared a small cube, HG-C with six separate AIEgen colored 
faces (cf. Figure 3a and Movie S2 of the Supporting Informa-
tion). Hydrogel HG-C was allowed to set for 24 h. This allowed 
for robust adhesion between the core hydrogel and the colored 
faces. With HG-C in hand, 27 HG-C blocks were adhered in a 
3 × 3 × 3 arrangement. After a relatively short adhesion time, 
1 h, RC was formed in stable fashion (Figure 3b and Movie S3 
of the Supporting Information). No disassembly or dispersion 
of the component hydrogels or AIEs was observed when RC 
was subject to gentle shaking or when repeatedly lifted up, 
thrown down, or turned over (cf. Figure 3c and Movie S4 of the 
Supporting Information).
Individual 1 × 3 × 3 layers within an RC may be rotated 
to change the pattern on each face and hence the cube as 
a whole. It was thus of interest to explore whether the pre-
sumed dynamic features of RC would permit such rotations 
(cf. Figure 4; cartoon representations on the left and photo-
graphs on the right). As shown in Figure 4a and Movie S5 of 
the Supporting Information, when the top 1 × 3 × 3 layer of 
RC is rotated horizontally 90° in a counterclockwise direction, 
the front face pattern P1 is transformed into pattern P2. The 
top two layers of RC were then rotated horizontally 90° in a 
clockwise direction; this changed the front face from pattern P2  
to P3. A subsequent horizontal 90° rotation in a counterclock-
wise direction produced pattern P0 on the front face. The 
horizontal rotation-induced pattern transformation reflects the 
difference of adhesion strength between hydrogels: The rela-
tively weak adhesion enables the RC to be rotated horizontally, 
while the strong interactions allow HG-C to be used as a stable 
(i.e., nondynamic) building block. Pattern transformations by 
vertical rotation were also investigated (Figure 4b; Movie S6, 
Supporting Information). For instance, rotating the middle and 
right two layers of RC vertically 90° in a counterclockwise direc-
tion served to change the front face pattern from P4 to P5. A 
subsequent vertical 90° rotation in a counterclockwise direction 
involving only the rightmost 1 × 3 × 3 layer served to convert 
pattern P5 to P0’. The vertical rotation-induced pattern trans-
formation thus likewise reflects the binding difference between 
hydrogels; again, the relatively weak adhesion enables the RC to 
be rotated vertically, while the strong interactions allow HG-C 
to be used as a stable building block.
The layers making up RC could also be rotated both horizon-
tally and vertically in a concerted fashion (Figure 4c and Movie S7  
of the Supporting Information). For instance, the right layer of 
RC could be rotated vertically 90° in a counterclockwise direc-
tion (causing the front face from pattern P6 to pattern P7). 
Then, the top layer of RC could be rotated horizontally 90° in a 
clockwise direction to convert the front face from pattern P7 to 
pattern P0’. On the basis of this observation, we conclude that 
the relatively weak adhesion between (as opposed to within) 
individual building blocks could be exploited to produce an-all

hydrogel-based RC system whose layers may be rotated freely 
in both the horizontal and vertical direction.
The pattern transformations engendered within RC by 
mechanical means are made possible by the time-dependent 
control over the dynamic covalent interactions at the hydrogel 
interfaces, which in turn reflects the time-dependent adhesion 
features of the underlying hydrogels. Specifically, the relatively 
weak adhesion that characterizes the intracube interactions 
within the RC stand in contrast to the strong interactions that 
allow HG-C to be used as a robust block to prepare the 3 × 3 × 3 
RC structure.
In contrast to what is true for traditional hard plastic 
Rubik’s Cube, RC is comprised of a soft material. Therefore, 
besides rotation, its patterns may be changed by other means. 
In fact, it proved possible to remove one cube HG-C from RC. 
The free HG-C cube can be rotated freely and then inserted 
back into the resulting gap to produce an intact RC but with 
a pattern that differs at three faces (Figure 5a; Movie S8, Sup-
porting Information). Such an ex situ pattern transformation is 
not easily achieved with a traditional Rubik’s Cube without risk 
of breakage. Furthermore, and again in contrast to what is true 
for a traditional Rubik’s Cube, the fluorescent AIEgen colors 
may be changed by treatment with an appropriate chemical 
stimulus. For example, AIE-RB
[50] is a blue fluorophore; how-
ever, the color of its fluorescent emission changes to orange 
after treatment with acid (Figure S34, Supporting Information). 
A new hydrogel, HG-7, containing AIE-RB was thus prepared; 
as expected, it was found to change from blue to orange over 
the course of 8 min upon exposure to acetic acid (Movie S9 and 
Figure S34, Supporting Information). This chemical stimulus-
based color change was recapitulated in an RC structure con-
taining one HG-7 bearing HG-C block (Figure 5bMovie S10, 
Supporting Information). This indicates the environment-
induced change of the RC face pattern. Finally, we found that 
the 3 × 3 × 3 RC structure can be divided physically to produce 
daughter products (including a 2 × 2 × 2 RC structure) that can 
be re-fused to create the original RC pattern or a different one 
(Figure 5c; Movie S11, Supporting Information). This trans-
formation between the starting 3 × 3 × 3 RC and the daughter 
2 × 2 × 2 RC structure means that the size of the patterns 
changes. This provides a further complement to pattern pro-
duction involving layer rotation, individual cube manipulation, 
and chemical treatment. This diversity is to our knowledge 
unique in the context of a materials-based colored array system.
In addition, according to previous studies, hydrogel mate-
rials can also be adhered to other normalized interactive surface 
areas.
[51–53] A number of parameters, including surface rough-
ness, wettability, and surface group density, are known to influ-
ence the macroscopic assembly and interaction results.
[54–56] We 
also note that the transient differences in the binding strength 
between the individual hydrogel building blocks and within the 
assembled RC are of interest in the context of soft materials. In

line with a recent suggestion from Whitesides, we specifically 
propose that systems such as described here may have a role to 
play in the preparation of soft robotics.

In conclusion, we prepared six AIE hydrogels showing 
different fluorescent colors and one hydrogel without an AIE 
dot. These seven hydrogels were used to create a cube structure,

hydrogel HG-C, bearing different AIE-based colored faces. 
Macroscopic adhesion of 27 of these HG-C building blocks 
with a short adhesion time (≈1 h) then allowed preparation of 
a Rubik’s Cube-like structure RC. Due to the dynamic nature 
of the contacts between the HG-C blocks within RC, physi-
cally driven changes to the structure and patterns of RC proved 
possible. In addition, ex situ or chemical stimulus approaches 
could be exploited to alter the RC color patterns. An attractive 
feature of the present RC structure is that it allows for the facile 
creation of multiple patterns. As such, it could see potential 
application in areas where pattern-dependent behavior could 
prove beneficial. On a more fundamental level, this study high-
lights how the temporal features, strong versus weak adhesion, 
of dynamic covalent hydrogels may be exploited to create easy-
to-manipulate macroscopic structures.
