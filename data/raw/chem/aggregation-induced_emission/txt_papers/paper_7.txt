1.Introduction
Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly
evolving ﬁeld that harnesses the pa-
tient’s immune system to combat ma-
lignant tumors, [1–5] oﬀering innovative
strategies alongside traditional thera-
pies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy.[6,7] A critical step in tumor
immunotherapy is achieving eﬃcient im-
munogenic cell death (ICD).[8,9] During
ICD, the release of damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs), including
calreticulin(CRT)andhighmobilitygroup
box 1 (HMGB1), promotes the matura-
tion of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cell
diﬀerentiation, activates the immune re-
sponse, and initiates adaptive antitumor
immunity.[10,11] Recently, evidence increas-
ingly suggests that an immune response
is elicited following photodynamic therapy
(PDT), highlighting its potential as an
immunogenic treatment approach. [12–14]
PDT is a non-invasive treatment that
oﬀers spatiotemporal control by utilizing
photosensitizers to produce singlet oxygen
(1O2) through energy transfer (Type II) or
other reactive oxygen species (ROS) via

electron transfer (Type I) when exposed to light, eﬀectively de-
stroying tumor tissue.[15–21] During PDT, cells undergo the pro-
cess of ICD, releasing DAMPs, and activating the systemic
adaptive immune response.[22–24] However, the immune eﬀects
elicited by PDT-induced ICD are inﬂuenced by several factors,
which can lead to suboptimal outcomes in immunotherapy.[9,25]
PDT should be combined with immune checkpoint blockade
reagentstoachieveabetteranti-tumorimmuneeﬀect. [26,27] The
primaryfactorsaﬀectingeﬃcacyinclude:1)thelimitedresidence
timeof photosensitizers in tumorcells, resultingin insuﬃcient
enrichment;[28] 2) hypoxia and the tumor’s antioxidant system,
which diminish the eﬀectiveness of PDT;[29,30] and 3) the ten-
dencyofPDTtoinduceapoptosis,whichisnotconducivetothe
releaseofDAMPs. [14] Therefore,toachievehighlyeﬀectiveanti-
tumor immunity, it is crucial to develop long-lasting photosen-
sitizers that can alleviate tumor hypoxia and antioxidant system
whileeﬀectivelyinducingICD.
To enhance the eﬃcacy of PDT, strategies such as designing
Type I photosensitizers and developing oxygen-carrying meth-
ods to increase tumor oxygen levels have been explored.[31–35]
However,simplyboostingtheoxidativecapacityofPDTisinade-
quate,asrobustantioxidantresponsesintumorcellscansignif-
icantly diminishits eﬀectiveness.[36] Malignant tumorsthatsur-
vivetheseresponsesmaydeveloptolerancetoPDT. [37] Therefore,
it is essential to develop photosensitizers that speciﬁcally target

tivatedalkyneandthiolclickreactionshavebeendevelopedand

Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers exhibit
superior ROS production eﬃciency in aggregated states com-
pared to traditional photosensitizers.[42–47] To leverage this ad-
vantage, we incorporated the covalent warhead alkynamide into
an AIE photosensitizer, developing an endoplasmic reticulum-
targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP-PA, aimed at alleviat-
ing hypoxia and evoking ferroptosis- and pyroptosis-mediated
immunotherapy.Alkynamidereactswiththiolcompoundssuch

tracellular substances and extending the retention time of the

leading to the release of a series of inﬂammatory factors and

presentingabilityofDCsandactivatetheTcells-dependentadap-
tive immune response. This systemic anti-tumor immunity ef-
fectivelydestroysprimarytumorsandeﬀectivelyinhibitsdistant

covalent AIE photosensitizer to alleviate hypoxia and promote
ferroptosis- and pyroptosis-mediated immunotherapy but also
provides a framework for discovering new materials to enhance
anti-tumorresponses.
1.1.PhotophysicalProperties
MBTP-PA with alkynamide was synthesized by re-
acting MBTP-A with propargylic acid in the pres-
ence of 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 1-(3-
Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC). Its structure
was conﬁrmed using13CN M R ,1H NMR, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (Figure 1A;F i g u r e sS1–S3, Supporting
Information). The photophysical properties of MBTP-PA were
initially examined. The UV–vis spectra revealed an absorption
peak (𝜆abs) at 463 nm in a dilute DMSO solution (Figure1B).
As depicted in photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Figure1C), the
emission peaks of MBTP-PA in solid ﬁlm and DMSO solution
were 652 and 666 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the AIE eﬀect
of MBTP-PA in DMSO/H2O mixtures was investigated because
MBTP-PA is soluble in DMSO but not in H2O. As shown
in Figure 1D,E, increasing the water fraction (fw)i nD M S O
signiﬁcantly enhanced the ﬂuorescence of MBTP-PA. Whenfw
increased from 40% to 50%, the PL intensity increased sharply,
demonstrating AIE characteristics. However, the PL intensity of
MBTP-PAdecreasedwhen fw exceeded80%.
TobetterunderstandthePLchangesofMBTP-PAaggregates,
we measured the particle size of MBTP-PA at varying water
contents. The results indicated that the average particle size at
50.36 nm (fw = 80%) was smaller than that at 224.6 nm (fw =
50%). The smaller particle size indicates that the eﬀective ag-
gregation of MBTP-PA was reduced, and the surface area was
increased, resulting in decreased PL intensity. In addition, the
absolute ﬂuorescence quantum yield (ФF) of MBTP-PA ranged
from 0.4% in DMSO to 6.8% in solid ﬁlm, explaining its AIE
properties(Table S1,SupportingInformation).Notably,duetoits
strongdonor-acceptorstructure,MBTP-PAexhibitspronounced
solvatochromism in solvents of varying polarity, including hex-
ane, 1,4-dioxane, ethyl acetate, and DMSO (FigureS4,S u p -
porting Information). To further investigate this donor-acceptor
structure, MBTP-PA was analyzed using density functional the-
ory (DFT) calculations. The geometries of MBTP-PA were opti-
mized using the M062x/6-31G** level (Figure1F). The delocal-
ized electron density of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) was primarily concentrated in the dimethoxytripheny-
lamine segment. In contrast, the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital(LUMO)wasconcentratedonthebenzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole
unit, demonstrating strong intramolecular charge transfer in
MBTP-PA. Furthermore, the energy level distribution between
singlet (S) and triplet (T) states was calculated (Figure1G). The
calculatedvaluesof ΔES1-T1 and ΔES1-T2 were0.75and −0.13eV,

PAiscapableofproducingreactiveoxygenspecies(ROS).
1.2.ExplorationofThiol-YneClickReactionofMBTP-PAwith
ThiolCompounds
After investigating its photophysical properties, we examined
the reactions of MBTP-PA with amino acids, peptides, and pro-
teinsthathaveamino,hydroxyl,andthiolgroups.MBTP-PAand
diﬀerent amino acids were added into a mixture of PBS and
THF (v/v= 1:1) with a pH 7.4, we found that L-lysine and L-
arginine (which contain amino group), as well as L-serine, and
L-tyrosine (which contain hydroxyl group), did not react with
MBTP-PA (Figure 2A,B). In contrast, Boc-Cys-OMe, Cys, and
GSH,whichcontainthiolgroups,reactedeﬃcientlywithMBTP-
PA (Figure2C;F i g u r e sS5–S8, Supporting Information). These
results demonstrate that MBTP-PA possesses high selectivity in
itsreactionwiththiolsubstances.Furthermore,bovineserumal-
bumin(BSA)waschosenasamodelproteintoverifythepoten-

1.3.AnalysisofROSGenerationAbilityandSpecies
To evaluate changes in ROS generation before and after MBTP-
PAinteractswithcellularsubstances,weassessedtheROSgen-
eration capacity and analyzed the ROS species of MBTP-PA,
MBTP-BSA, MBTP-PA+BSA, MBTP-A, and Chlorin e6 (Ce6).
We used 2,7-dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein (DCFH), a commercial
indicator that detects various types of ROS, as a reporter for
ROS activity. As illustrated inFigures 3A and S9 (Supporting
Information), the PL intensity of the DCFH solution contain-
ingphotosensitizerssigniﬁcantlyincreasedwithprolongedwhite
light irradiation time (10 mW cm−2). The rates of PL inten-
sity growth were ranked as follows: MBTP-PA+BSA > MBTP-
PA > MBTP-BSA > MBTP-A > Ce6. These ﬁndings reveal that
MBTP-PA has a greater ROS generation capacity than MBTP-
A and Ce6. Notably, the ROS production rate decreased after
MBTP-PA reacted with BSA, likely due to the formation of
MBTP-BSA.

To identify the type of ROS generated by MBTP-PA, dihy-
drorhodamine 123 (DHR123) and hydroxyphenyl ﬂuorescein
(HPF) were applied as indicators for superoxide radical (O2
−•)
and hydroxyl radical (HO·), respectively. This approach allowed
ustocharacterizethephotosensitizers’capacitytoproduceType
I ROS. As shown in Figures3Band S10(Supporting Informa-
tion),thePLintensityoftheseindicatorsvariedwithlightirradia-
tiontime.TheproductionrateofO 2

PA+BSA>MBTP-PA>MBTP-BSA>MBTP-A>Ce6,whilethe
production rate of HO· was ranked as follows: MBTP-PA+BSA
>Ce6>MBTP-PA ≈ MBTP-BSA>MBTP-A(Figure 3C;Figure
S11,SupportingInformation).TheseresultsindicatethatMBTP-
PAexhibitsastrongerabilitytoproduceTypeIROSthanMBTP-
A for both O2
−• and HO·, with a notable decrease in the pro-
duction rate of Type I ROS observed after MBTP-PA reacts with
BSA. In addition, 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-
oxide (BMPO) was used to capture HO· and O2
−• generated by
MBTP-PAandMBTP-Aunderwhitelight(Figure S12,Support-
ingInformation).Thecharacteristicsignalofelectronparamag-
neticresonance(EPR)wasdetected,providingadditionalconﬁr-
mationoftheTypeIROSgeneration.
On the other hand, 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene) di-
malonic acid (ABDA) was utilized as a1O2 indicator to de-
termine whether Type II ROS was generated. As shown in
Figures 4D and S13(Supporting Information), the decompo-
sition rate of ABDA across all groups, except for Ce6, aligned
closely with that of the control group, and no signiﬁcant EPR
signal was detected, when the1O2 was captured using 2,2,6,6-
tetramethylpiperidine(TEMP)(Figure S14,SupportingInforma-
tion), indicating that MBTB-PA did not produce1O2. Collec-
tively, these results aﬃrm that MBTP-PA functions as a Type I
photosensitizer.

1.4.FluorescenceImagingandAntitumorActivityAnalysis
Following our investigation of the ROS production capacity of
MBTP-PA, we further examined its localization and anti-tumor
activity within cells. In order to highlight the characteristics of
the covalent photosensitizer MBTP-PA, we selected MBTP-A as
acontrol.First,weexaminedthecellularuptakeratesandreten-
tion time of both MBTP-PA and MBTP-A. As shown in Figures
S15andS16(SupportingInformation),4T1cellswereincubated
either with MBTP-PA or MBTP-A, and confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM) was employed to capture images at various
time points. By analyzing the mean ﬂuorescence intensity in
the cells, we found that the intracellular accumulation of both
compoundsincreasedovertime,withMBTP-Aenteringthecells
more rapidly than MBTP-PA. After 24 h of incubation, we re-
placed the medium to observe the change in intracellular ﬂuo-
rescenceintensity.AsshowninFigure S17(SupportingInforma-
tion),MBTP-PAexhibitedalongerretentiontimeofintracellular

tosensitizershavesuperiorretentionincells.
Tofurtherelucidatethediﬀerencesinintracellulardistribution
between MBTP-A and MBTP-PA, we conducted co-localization
experiments using commercial organelle biomarkers. The re-
sults revealed that Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of 0.87 be-
tween MBTP-A and Lyso-Tracker Green, indicating that MBTP-
A predominantly localized in lysosomes (Figure4A). In con-
trast,MBTP-PAshowedahighdegreeofoverlapwithER-Tracker
Green, yielding the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of 0.91,
compared to lower correlations with Mito-Tracker Green, Lyso-
TrackerGreen,andBodipy(Figure 4B).
Subsequently, we evaluated the tumor-killing eﬃcacy of
MBTP-PA in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, leveraging
itsrobustROSgenerationcapacityofandchemicalreactivity.In
the absence of white light irradiation, over 50% of MBTP-PA-
stained 4T1 cells were killed at concentrations exceeding 8μm
(Figure 4C). However, MBTP-PA maintained over 80% of cell

1.5.ResearchontheMechanismofCellDeath
The reaction of covalent photosensitizers MBTP-PA with thiol
compounds induced intracellular oxidative stress. Previous
studies have shown that redox imbalance is associated with
ferroptosis.[48,49] Therefore, we investigated the ferroptosis trig-
gered by MBTP-PA. GSH is a critical reducing agent that main-
tains the redox balance in cells. Our analysis revealed that the
intracellular GSH levels of MBTP-PA and MBTP-PA+Lg r o u p s
were lower compared to the control group (Figure5A). This re-
ductionwasattributedtotheconsumptionofGSHandthesub-
sequent generation of substantial amounts of ROS under white

tion assays indicated that the level of malondialdehyde (MDA),
a byproduct of oxidation, in the MBTP-PA group was compa-
rable to that of the control group. However, after the cells un-
derwent PDT, the MBTP-PA+L group exhibited signiﬁcantly el-
evated MDA levels compared to the other groups (Figure5C),
suggestingthatMBTP-PAinducestumorcelldeathviaferropto-

pothesized that the antitumor activity of MBTP-PA is not solely
dependentontheferroptosis.Furthermore,weobservedthatthe

To validate our hypothesis, we assessed the factors associated
withpyroptosis.Theresultsrevealedthatinﬂammatorycytokines
(IL-1𝛽andIL-18)andlactatedehydrogenase(LDH)werereleased
in the treatment group (Figure5F–H). In addition, pyroptosis-
related proteins were analyzed. Notably, the levels of GSDMD
andpro-caspase-1weresigniﬁcantlyreducedintheMBTP-PA +L
group,whilethelevelsofGSDMD-Nandcleaved-caspase-1were
increased(Figure 5I).TheseresultsindicatethatMBTP-PAgen-
erates ROS upon light irradiation, which activates caspase-1
withinthecells.ThisactivationleadstothecleavageofGSDMD
intoitsactiveGSDMD-Nfragments,whichsubsequentlytranslo-
cate to the cell membrane, forming pores to induce pyroptosis.
Next, we veriﬁed pyroptosis-mediated immunogenic cell death
(ICD)bydetectingcalreticulin(CRT)andHGMB-1biomarkers.
As shown in Figure5J,K, the exposure of CRT in MBTP-PA-
stained 4T1 cells signiﬁcantly increased under light irradiation.
Additionally,HMGB1wasfoundtomigratefromthenucleusto
the cytoplasm and ATP was signiﬁcantly released in the treat-
mentgroup(Figure S20,SupportingInformation).Theseresults
indicate that MBTP-PA eﬀectively induces the ICD, activating
the adaptive immune responses through pyroptosis upon light
irradiation.

To facilitate the in vivo application of MBTP-PA, DSPE-PEG2000
and DSPE-PEG2000-cRGD were utilized to encapsulate MBTP-
PA, because they have the advantages of increased drug circu-
lation time, enhanced stability, reduced protein adsorption, and
improvedencapsulationeﬃciency.[52] ThismethodformsMBTP-
PA nanoparticles (MBTP-PA-NPs) with an average particle size
of 110.9 nm and a zeta potential of−33.4 eV (Figure 6A–C).
and the encapsulation eﬃciency is 46.7%. The long-term parti-
clesizestabilitytestconﬁrmedthatMBTP-PA-NPsremainstable
for up to 30 days (Figure6D; FigureS21, Supporting Informa-
tion). Photophysical characterization demonstrated that MBTP-
PA-NPs exhibit an absorption maximum of 472 nm, a maxi-
mum emission peak of 650 nm, and an absolute ﬂuorescence
quantumyieldof6.4%(Figure S22,SupportingInformation).In
addition, cellular uptake and ﬂuorescence colocalization imag-
ing showed that MBTP-PA-NPs entered cells more rapidly than

and their distribution was monitored using ﬂuorescence mi-

notably higher in the liver, lung, and tumor, indicating that the
MBTP-PA-NPs primarily accumulated in these organs and tis-
sues (Figure6F). By 48 h, the ﬂuorescence intensity in the liver
and lung decreased and increased in the tumor. This suggests

thatMBTP-PA-NPssigniﬁcantlyinhibitedthegrowthofthepri-
mary tumor. Notably, the MBTP-PA-NPs+L group showed even
greateranti-tumoractivitycomparedtoMBTP-PA-NPsalone,at-
tributed to the synergistic eﬀects of intracellular reactions and
PDT. Regarding the distant tumors, their growth was signiﬁ-
cantly suppressed in the MBTP-PA-NPs+L group, likely due to
theimmuneresponseelicitedbythistherapeuticapproach.
Inaddition,hematoxylinandeosin(H&E)tumorstainingwas
conducted to assess cell morphology. Notable voids and kary-
opyknosis were observed in the primary tumors treated with
MBTP-PA-NPs and the distant tumors treated with the MBTP-
PA-NPs+Lgroup.IntheprimarytumoroftheMBTP-PA-NPs +L

To investigate the immunological mechanisms underlying
pyroptosis-mediated photoimmunotherapy induced by MBTP-
PA-NPs, we conducted immunological analyses on the spleen
and distant tumors four days post-treatment. Staining of CRT
and HMGB1 in distant tumors showed the expression of both
markers in the MBTP-PA-NPs and MBTP-PA-NPs+Lg r o u p s
(Figure8B). Subsequently, we analyzed the presence of mature
dendritic cells (DCs) and activated immune cells. In the spleen,
the proportion of mature DCs (CD86+,C D 8 0+)w a sf o u n dt o

groups, respectively, much higher than those in the control
group,indicatingthatboththereactiveactivityandthephotody-
namic eﬀects of MBTP-PA contribute to the maturation of DCs
(Figure8C).
To further investigate whether mature DCs can activate dif-
ferent types of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), we analyzed the lev-
els of these T cell subsets in distant tumors using ﬂow cytome-
try. The results showed a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion
of eﬀector CD4+ T cells in the MBTP-PA-NPs+L group, while
the proportion of CD8+ did not obviously change (FigureS29,
Supporting Information). These ﬁndings indicate that CD4+ T
cells play a pivotal role in photodynamic immunotherapy. This

2.Conclusion
This study successfully integrates a covalent warhead, alky-
namide into an AIE type I photosensitizer, culminating in the
development of the novel targeted endoplasmic reticulum cova-
lent photosensitizer, MBTP-PA. It facilitates ferroptosis and py-
roptosis, enabling a synergistic approach to photodynamic im-
munotherapy. It also demonstrates its covalent capability by ef-
ﬁciently reacting with thiol compounds such as Cys, GSH, and
BSA. Additionally, it outperforms the non-covalent photosensi-
tizer MBTP-A in terms of cellular retention and the induction
of intracellular oxidative stress, which help alleviate tumor hy-
poxia and enhance the eﬃcacy of photodynamic therapy. More
importantly,theMBTP-PA-NPsnotonlypromoteferroptosisand
pyroptosisthroughthiol-ynereactiontherapyandphotodynamic
therapy,butalsoinitiatetheICD.Thiswasvalidatedthroughanti-
tumorexperimentsinabilateral4T1tumormodel,demonstrat-
ing the eﬀective elimination of primary tumors and signiﬁcant
suppression of distant tumors. And MBTP-PA-NPs have no ap-
parent damage to normal tissues, showing excellent biosafety.
Overall, this research not only introduces a new class of co-
valent photosensitizers, but also provides a framework for de-
veloping advanced therapeutic materials to improve anti-tumor
strategies.
3.ExperimentalSection
SynthesisofMBTP-PA : MBTP-A(0.4mmol,212mg),EDC(0.8mmol,
124 mg), and DCM (12.0 mL) were placed into a 50 mL round bottom
ﬂask. Propiolic acid (0.6 mmol, 42 mg) was then added slowly to the
mixture in the ice water bath. Next, the solution of DMAP (0.02 mmol,
2.4 mg) in DCM (8.0 mL) was added dropwise into the above mixture.
Then, the temperature was spontaneously warmed to room-temperature
and the reaction was stirred for 3 h (the progress of the reaction was
monitoredbyTLC).Aftercompletionofthereaction,thereactionwasex-
tracted three times with water and DCM. The organic phase was dried
with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The DCM was removed under vacuum
and the resultant residue was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography on sil-
ica gel to get the red solid MBTP-PA in 55% yield (eluent: DCM).1H

Intracellular Reaction: 4T1 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 6×
105 cells per well and incubated for 12 h. The medium was then replaced
with fresh DMEM (10% FBS) containing MBTP-A or MBTP-PA (100μm).
After 24 h of incubation with the compounds, the medium was removed,
andthecellswerewashedthreetimeswithPBS.Thecellswerecollected,

Preparation of Nanoparticles: MBTP-PA (1.0 mg), DSPE-PEG2000-
cRGD (1.5 mg), and DSPE-PEG2000 (1.5 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL of
THF under ultrasonic dispersion. Then the homogeneous mixture was
quickly added to ultrapure water (10 mL). After sonication using a probe
sonicator for 3 min, the mixture was collected and concentrated by cen-
trifugal ﬁlters for further use. The obtained nanoparticles were stored at
4 °C.
Establishment of 4T1 Tumor Models: The Animal Ethics Committee
of the South China Agricultural University granted approval for all ani-
malexperimentprotocols(approvalnumber:2023d098).Abilateraltumor

left and right hips of mice at−8a n d−2 days prior to treatment, respec-
tively,toinduceprimaryanddistanttumors.
In Vivo Biodistribution Evaluation: The mice bearing 4T1 tumors were
administered with MBTP-PA-NPs (11.67 mg kg−1) through tail-vein in-
jection (n = 3). After injection for several times (24, 48, 72, and 96 h),
these mice were euthanized to extract heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney,
and tumor. Fluorescence imaging of these tissues were conducted using
animagingsystem.
InVivoTherapeuticEﬃcacyEvaluation : The4T1tumor-bearingBALB/c
mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6). The mice in each
group were systemically administrated with PBS or MBTP-PA-NPs (3.5
mg kg−1) through intratumor injection. After administrated for 24 h,
the primary tumors of mice were exposed under white light irradiation
(150mWcm −2)for30min.Afterdiﬀerenttreatments,thetherapeuticeﬃ-
cacieswereevaluatedbymeasuringthesizesofbothprimaryanddistant
tumors every 2 days for 14 days. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated ac-
cording to the formula: V= (tumor length)× (tumor width)2/2. After 14
daysoftreatments,themiceineachgroupwereeuthanized,andboththe
primary and distant tumors were extracted to weigh. The wavelength of
whitelightwas400–1000nm.
