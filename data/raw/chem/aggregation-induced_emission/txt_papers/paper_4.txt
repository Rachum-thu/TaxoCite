ABSTRACT: Organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP)
materials hold significant promise for applications in optoelec-
tronics, information security, and bioimaging. Recently, significant
progress has been made in RTP materials and vacuum-deposited
organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices. However, the
performance of solution-processed OLEDs is seriously lagging
behind due to the lack of RTP molecular strategies that balance
exciton stability and solution processability at the single-molecule
scale. In this work, we propose an acceptor dendronization strategy
for designing RTP materials and successfully achieving highly
efficient and stable RTP emissions. This strategy can simultaneously
enhance the various processes involved in RTP emission at the
single-molecule level: increase the intersystem crossing channels,
enhance the spin−orbit coupling constants between T
1
and S
0
, and suppress molecular motion. Consequently, it promotes
intersystem crossing and triplet radiative transition while inhibiting nonradiative transition, thereby efficiently enhancing RTP
emission. A proof-of-concept acceptor-dendronized dendrimer exhibits long phosphorescence lifetimes in the millisecond range in
ambient solution and near 100% photoluminescent quantum yields in the doped films. This is the first reported RTP dendrimer to
date. An OLED fabricated using this dendrimer in a sky-blue emission achieves an external quantum efficiency of 25.1%, which
represents the state-of-the-art efficiency based on solution-processed RTP-OLEDs to date. Our findings offer definitive guidelines for
the molecular engineering of RTP materials and pave the way for innovative RTP systems in diverse optoelectronic applications.

INTRODUCTION
Organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP)
1−5
has
emerged as an attractive research topic with multiple potential
applications in optoelectronic devices,
6
information anticoun-
terfeiting,
7
biomedical imaging,
8
phosphorescence probes,
9
and
biosensing.
10
This interest is due to the full utilization of the
radiative relaxation of the triplet excited state. Although
numerous RTP materials have been developed, their inefficient
phosphorescence at room temperature is the main limitation
for practical applications. The primary challenges include two
aspects: First, the spin forbidden property leads to insufficient
intersystem crossing (ISC),
11
and the intrinsic phosphor-
escence quantum yield is generally lower than the theoretical
limit. Second, traditional methods such as crystallization,
12,13
matrix rigidification,
14,15
and supramolecular self-assembly
16,17
rely on constructing rigid confinement environments to
enhance exciton stability, but these approaches sacrifice
material processability, making it difficult to meet practical
applications. In recent years, researchers have been trying to
develop different strategies to improve the RTP efficiency,
including vacuum evaporation and solution processing-type
RTP materials. The main strategies include: introducing
heteroatoms (O, N, S, and P)
4
with abundant lone pair
electrons to enhance spin orbit coupling (SOC), building twist
donor−acceptor (D-A) structures to reduce the single triplet
energy gap difference (ΔE
ST
),
18
and constructing rigid
confinements to suppress molecular motion to reduce
nonradiative transitions
19
(Figure 1). For example, Su et al.
20
reported a phenoxyselenide donor-triazine acceptor molecule
exhibiting a strong SOC (S
0
, T

) of 108.48 cm

and multiple
hydrogen bonds that rigidify the molecular skeleton. The

(OLED) device achieved an external quantum efficiency
(EQE) of 19.5%. Additionally, Zhao et al.
21
demonstrated a
rigid indolocarbazole-xanthenone system with a ∼60° twist
angle, achieving a small ΔE
ST
(0.28 eV) and a high PLQY
(72%), leading to a nondoped vacuum-deposited OLED with a
record EQE of 24.9%.
In comparison, solution-processed OLEDs
22
offer advan-
tages such as low-cost fabrication, high material utilization,
simple processing (e.g., inkjet printing or spin coating), and
compatibility with flexible/large-area devices. Early molecular
designs focused on enhancing SOC through heteroatoms/
heavy atoms. For example, Ceroni et al.
23
reported a
thiophenol-functionalized benzene derivative with six flexible
substituents, but excessive molecular motion limited its device
EQE to only 0.1%. Later, Ding et al.
24
developed an oxygen-
containing D-A-structured RTP polymer, where oxygen atoms
reduced orbital overlap to enhance SOC while polymer rigidity
suppressed nonradiative decay. This system achieved a
solution-processed OLED EQE of 9.7%. However, solution-
processed RTP devices currently show significantly lower
efficiencies than vacuum-deposited counterparts (EQE < 10%
vs >20%). The bottleneck stems from conflicting require-
ments: solution processability necessitates flexible molecular
designs, whereas suppressing nonradiative triplet deactivation
demands rigid environments.
Dendrimers
25−28
hold potential to construct efficient
solution-processed RTP materials owing to their unique
advantages, including abundant functional adjustability, high
morphological stability, and excellent solution processability.
These properties may overcome the efficiency bottleneck of
solution-processed RTP-OLED devices. However, research on
RTP dendrimers remains rare due to the absence of established
molecular design principles. The conventional donor-dendro-
nization strategy�introducing dendrons into donors to form
acceptor−donor−dendron (A-D-D′) architectures�has failed
to exhibit RTP. This approach excessively strengthens
electron-donating effects, depletes hole density in the accept-
or’s triplet state, and consequently weakens spin−orbit
coupling (SOC) while impeding efficient spin-flip processes.
A promising alternative involves increasing the acceptor’s
triplet hole density through acceptor dendronization. For
instance, the thermally activated delayed fluorescence
(TADF)
29,30
molecule BPSAF
31
(Figure 1) combines a strong
carbonyl acceptor with a spiro[acridine-9,9’-fluorene] (SAF)
donor, achieving both a small ΔE
ST
and a large SOC constant.
Nevertheless, despite efficient ISC in BPSAF and other TADF
systems, RTP emission remains elusive. Highly branched
dendrimers, such as 1,3,5-tris(3′,6′-di-tert-butyl-9H-[3,9′-bi-
carbazol]-9-yl)benzene (TC), contain rigid and bulky periph-
eral carbazole dendrons. When these dendrons are attached to
a benzophenone (BP) acceptor to form a donor−acceptor−
dendron (D-A-D′)-typed asymmetric dendrimer (dTC-
BPSAF) (Figure 1), they not only increase intramolecular
interactions, which lead to energy level splitting and an
enhancement of ISC channels, but also enhance the hole
density of triplet and
3
(n, π*) characteristics in the BP
acceptor, resulting in high SOC constants for efficient triplet
radiation.
In addition, the dTC-BPSAF dendrimer also demonstrates
multiple molecular interactions and a rigid dendronized
structure, which lead to restricted molecular motion, stabilized
triplet excitons, and suppressed nonradiative transitions,
thereby resulting in efficient RTP emission in solution.
Experiments conducted with the dendrimer in ambient dilute
toluene solution demonstrate that despite the presence of
dissolved oxygen at a concentration of 8.67 × 10
−3
M
32
at
room temperature, the RTP emission remains ultrastable in
both aerated and deaerated solutions. These results indicate
that the dendrons attached to the acceptor can also effectively
protect the triplet excitons of dTC-BPSAF from being
quenched by oxygen, thereby achieving ultrastable RTP
emission in ambient solution with a photoluminescence
quantum yield (PLQY) of 34%. Furthermore, to further
reduce molecular motion and quenching of triplet excitons, the
dTC-BPSAF dendrimer was doped into the host films,
resulting in a high PLQY of ∼100%. Additionally, the
solution-processed RTP-OLEDs achieved a record-high EQE
of 25.1%. These remarkable results validate the effectiveness of

RTP both in solution and in solid states, elucidating the
mechanism of restricting molecular motion to achieve efficient
RTP.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Quantum-Chemical Calculations. The acceptor dendro-
nization strategy can effectively regulate the population of
triplet excitons by increasing the splitting of triplet energy
levels and enhancing the proportion of locally excited (LE)
characteristics of the acceptor in the lowest triplet state (T
1
)
state. These two factors are anticipated to promote ISC
processes from the lowest singlet (S
1
) to T
1
and triplet
radiative transitions from the T
1
back to the ground state (S
0
),
thus achieving highly efficient RTP. To analyze and predict the
feasibility and reliability of the acceptor-dendronized strategy,
quantum-chemical calculations were performed on dTC-
BPSAF, BPSAF, and the donor-dendronized dendrimer
BPSAF-DCz for comparison, to investigate two crucial
photophysical processes: (1) the enhancement of ISC spin-
flipping processes from the S
1
to triplet state (T
n
) (k
ISC
) and
(2) the facilitation of the phosphorescent decay rate from the
T
1
to the S
0
(k
P
). The ISC process was evaluated based on eq

where a smaller ΔE
ST
, coupled with more ISC channels and
larger spin−orbit coupling operator (H
̂
SOC
), can enhance k
ISC
.
First, dTC-BPSAF inherits the HOMO and LUMO distribu-
tions of BPSAF (Figure S1), resulting in a very small ΔE
S1−T1
(0.02 eV). Second, the introduction of dendrons increases the
density of triplet states and reduces the triplet−triplet energy
gaps (ΔE
TT
), which increases valid ISC channels (ΔE
ST
≤ 0.3
eV and SOC ≥ 0.3 cm
−1
) from S
1
to T
n
.
34
Specifically, the
number of valid ISC channels of dTC-BPSAF is three (S
1
→T
1
,
T
2
, and T
9
) (Figure 2a), while the ISC channels of BPSAF is
only one (S
1
→T
2
with a ΔE
S1‑T2
of −0.09 eV). In comparison,
donor-dendronized BPSAF-DCz also exhibits only one ISC
channel (S
1
→T
2
) with a ΔE
S1‑T2
of −0.24 eV. Although donor
dendronization increases the density of triplet states, it fails to
enhance the effective ISC channels. These results indicate that
acceptor dendronization is an effective strategy to enhance the
ISC process by increasing the number of ISC channels.
Additionally, the large SOC (T
1
, S
0
) and the transition
dipole moment between the T
1
and S
0
states (μ
T d

significant factors in achieving efficient RTP, and the wave

BPSAF, electrons are predominantly localized on the BP

(25.6%; Figure S2). In contrast, for BPSAF, the T
1
state
exhibits hole and electron distributions that are separately
localized on the SAF donor (94.2%) and the BP acceptor
(98.6%), respectively. The character of T
1
of BPSAF, which is
predominantly CT (92.9%) with a small LE (7.1%)
component, shifts to the hybridized local charge-transfer
(HLCT) state of dTC-BPSAF, where the CT component is
reduced to 56.3%, and the LE component increases to 43.7%.
More importantly, the LE character of the BP acceptor (LE
A
)
increases significantly from 5.3% in BPSAF to 21.6% in dTC-
BPSAF (Figure 2b,c). These results suggest that the acceptor
dendronization can significantly enhance the LE character in
the acceptor. In comparison, donor-dendronized BPSAF-DCz
exhibits CT characteristics in the T
1
state with a small LE
proportion of 4.67%, indicating that donor dendronization not
only fails to increase the LE characteristics of BPSAF but also
reduces them.
Meanwhile, the hole−electron overlap in carbonyl oxygen
(overlap(O)) also displays an obvious increase after acceptor
dendronization, from 5.17% in BPSAF to 12.9% in dTC-
BPSAF (Figure 2b,c). Thanks to acceptor dendronization,
carbonyl oxygen exhibits a large distribution degree of holes,
originating from adjacent electron-donating carbazole dendritic
structures. These results indicate that the acceptor dendroniza-
tion strategy successfully enhances hole distributions in the
acceptor and increases the
3
(n, π*) characteristics, which can
substantially increase the SOC constants and facilitate triplet
radiative transitions.
37
On the contrary, the value of overlap
(O) significantly decreases to as low as 0.32% in BPSAF-DCz,
which is unfavorable for the n↔π transition and spin flip
process. This decrease is because the donor-dendronized
BPSAF-DCz enhances its electron-donating ability and
weakens the hole distribution of the acceptor, leading to few
3
(n, π*) configurations and a low likelihood of emitting RTP.
Consequently, the SOC (T
1
, S
0
) and μ
T d
1
→S d
0
of BPSAF increase
significantly from 9.07 cm
−1
and 4.29 × 10
−8
D to 17.35 cm
−1
and 1.03 × 10
−5
D for dTC-BPSAF (Figure 2d), indicating
that dTC-BPSAF is expected to exhibit efficient RTP. In
contrast, the SOC (T
1
, S
0
) is only 3.49 cm
−1
and μ
T d
1
→S d
0
is only
1.2 × 10
−8
D for BPSAF-DCz, suggesting that RTP is unlikely
to be observed in BPSAF-DCz. These results indicate that,
unlike donor dendronization, the acceptor dendronization
strategy enables the dTC-BPSAF to exhibit greater LE
characteristics and
3
(n, π*) configuration, thereby facilitating
RTP emission.
To explore the origin of the enhanced hole distribution in
the T
1
of the acceptor in dTC-BPSAF, we statistically analyzed
the contributions of HOMOs to the hole in the T
1
state of
these compounds, as shown in Figure 2e and Figures S3−S6.
For dTC-BPSAF, the HOMO contributes only 52.5% to the

hole of the T
1
state, with HOMO-21 and HOMO-10
accounting for 12.9 and 11.3%, respectively. In contrast, for
BPSAF, HOMO contributes 95.9% while HOMO-6 contrib-
utes only 2.6% to the hole of the T
1
state. Similarly, in the
donor-dendronized BPSAF-DCz, HOMO contributes 93.9%,
and HOMO-4 contributes 4.6% to the hole of T
1
state.
Meanwhile, the contributions of LUMO to the electron in the
T
1
state of dTC-BPSAF, BPSAF, and BPSAF-DCz are
significant (>80%), indicating that the effect of electron
changes on the LE and LE
A
properties is relatively small. These
results suggest that the donor dendronization strategy fails to
generate more molecular orbitals for hole distributions of the
carbonyl oxygen. In comparison, the acceptor dendronization
effectively modulates the electronic structure of the T
1
state,
combining different mixtures of molecular orbitals to enhance
the hole distributions in carbonyl oxygen and the
3
(n, π*)
configuration of the triplet state. To investigate the universality
of this acceptor dendronization strategy to achieve RTP, we
conducted calculations on the excited states of small molecules
BPSAX and BPSAT, and the corresponding dendrimers dTC-
BPSAX and dTC-BPSAT (Figures S7−S9). Our calculated
findings reveal that acceptor dendronization can also lead to an
increase in the ISC pathways, SOC (T
1
, S
0
), and μ
T d
1
→S d
0
for
these dendrimers, and they are anticipated to exhibit efficient
RTP. These calculated results support the universality of the
acceptor dendronization strategy to achieve efficient RTP
emission.
Photoluminescence Behaviors in Solution. To verify
the feasibility of this acceptor dendronization strategy for
achieving efficient RTP, the acceptor-dendronized dendrimer
dTC-BPSAF was successfully synthesized. The synthetic routes
and fundamental characterizations of dTC-BPSAF are found in
Scheme S1 and Figures S10, S11, and S38−S48. The
ultraviolet−visible absorption spectrum (Figure 3a) in toluene
solution reveals the presence of an intramolecular charge-
transfer band spanning approximately 350−400 nm and the
absorption bands at 350 nm can be assigned to the π−π*
transitions of the dTC-BPSAF dendrimer. In the photo-
luminescence (PL) spectrum measured in toluene, dTC-
BPSAF exhibits a sky-blue prompt emission peak centered at
494 nm. In the delayed PL spectrum with a delayed time of 0.1
ms, dTC-BPSAF exhibits a structureless emission at 497 nm,
suggesting that the long-lived emission spectra may originate
from triplet states. The PL behaviors at room temperature are
similar to those at a low temperature (Figure S12). The
transient PL decay spectra of dTC-BPSAF and BPSAF in air-
equilibrated toluene were measured for comparison (Figure
3b). dTC-BPSAF displays a significant long-lived lifetime of
1.85 ms, but BPSAF shows a noticeably shorter delayed
lifetime of 161 ns. The long lifetime of dTC-BPSAF is also
demonstrated in different solvents (Figure S13). To determine
the origin of the much longer lifetime due to acceptor
dendronization, the temperature-dependent PL decay curves of
dTC-BPSAF from 198 to 378 K were measured in air (Figure
3c). The lifetimes of the long-lived components decrease
monotonically with increasing temperature, which is opposite
to TADF
29,30
and consistent with phosphorescence
21
(Figures
S14 and S15). The fluorescence and delayed fluorescence with
a short lifetime of dTC-BPSAF are also observed in toluene
(Figure S16). To compare the air stability, the phosphor-
escence decay spectrum in nitrogen-filled toluene solution of
dTC-BPSAF is measured and shows a lifetime (1.92 ms)
similar to that in air, indicating that the RTP from dTC-BPSAF
remains highly stable in solutions with and without oxygen
38
(Figure S17). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
measurements
39
suggest that the triplet excitons generated by
dTC-BPSAF exhibit low production of
1
O
2
, which further
illustrates the high stability of dTC-BPSAF against oxygen and
triplet exciton quenching (Figures S18 and S19). These results
demonstrated that acceptor dendronization can efficiently
suppress phosphorescence quenching caused by oxygen in
solution.
The in-solution phosphorescence of dTC-BPSAF can be
inferred to originate from inhibited molecular motion and
suppressed nonradiative transitions. Generally, strong spatial
(intermolecular and intramolecular) interactions can signifi-
cantly rigidify molecular structures and limit molecular motion,
which is beneficial to stable triplet exciton.
40
In dilute
solutions, the distance between two solute molecules is large,
and intermolecular interactions can be ignored. Therefore,
intramolecular interactions of the bulky dendrons after
acceptor dendronization can be attributed to the main factors
affecting the molecular motion of dTC-BPSAF (Figure S20).
The intramolecular interactions (atomic distance d < 3.5 Å)
41
of a single molecule can be estimated by calculating the
number of through-space short contacts (TSSCs) of dTC-
BPSAF based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using
the GROMACS 2023.1 package
42
(Figure 3d). The average of
TSSCs between the D-A core (red and green color) and
dendrons (blue color) (Figure 1b,c) for dTC-BPSAF is 34.4,
and the value of BPSAF is only 4.25 (Figure S21), indicating
significantly increased intramolecular interactions due to
acceptor dendronization. Therefore, the much greater intra-
molecular interactions of dTC-BPSAF effectively restrict
molecular motion and stabilize the triplet excitons for emitting
RTP in solution.
Femtosecond transient absorption measurements were
conducted to probe the energy dissipation process in dTC-
BPSAF and BPSAF. Upon photoexcitation at 340 nm with a
pump laser, there was a rapid increase in absorption in the
excited-state absorption (ESA) spectrum (Figure 3e and Figure
S22), exhibiting an ESA peak at ∼600 nm. No apparent peak
shift was observed in the ESA. The femtosecond transient
absorption measurement of dTC-BPSAF exhibits two decay
time constants, namely, 9.68 ps (derived from exciton−phonon
coupling) and 631 ps (derived from energy dissipation
pathway from molecular motion).
43
For BPSAF, the two
decay time constants are 0.44 and 14.8 ps. The longer decay
lifetime of dTC-BPSAF is attributed to the slower singlet
energy dissipation pathway due to the more crowded
molecular structures. The bulky molecular structure enables
dTC-BPSAF to convert absorbed photons into excitons, which
can slowly undergo nonradiative recombination and inefficient
energy transfer from dTC-BPSAF to the surrounding solvent
through molecular motion. The singlet nonradiative decay
rates were calculated using the Molecular Materials Property
Prediction Package (MOMAP) software.
44
The rate of
acceptor-dendronized dTC-BPSAF (1.29 × 10
7
s
−1
) is much
smaller than that of BPSAF (3.12 × 10
9
s
−1
), which is
consistent with ESA dynamic results. These findings suggest
that acceptor dendronization can effectively retard the energy
dissipation process by restricting the structural motion.
To further explore the effects of molecular motion and PL
behavior, the average PL lifetimes of dTC-BPSAF and BPSAF
in toluene at different temperatures are plotted, as shown in
Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.org/JACS Article
https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c06288

Figure 3f and Figure S23. In low temperatures, both exhibit
phosphorescence with long lifetimes due to the highly
restricted molecular motion. As the temperature increases,
molecular motion becomes more vigorous, and the PL lifetime
of dTC-BPSAF gradually shortens to the submillisecond level,
indicating that the dendritic structure with strong intra-
molecular interactions can greatly suppress triplet exciton
quenching at high temperatures. In contrast, the PL lifetime of
BPSAF with a flexible structure sharply decreases with heating,
phosphorescence rapidly disappears, and only delayed
fluorescence is displayed. These results suggest that intra-
molecular interactions can stabilize the triplet exciton by
restricting molecular motion, resulting in significantly stable
phosphorescence to counterbalance the exciton loss caused by
molecular thermal motion.
To directly demonstrate the molecular motion of dTC-
BPSAF and BPSAF, we further employed variable temperature
(VT)
1
H NMR in dicloromethane-d
2
to investigate their
mobility (Figure 4 and Figures S24−S28). At 298 K, the
1
H
NMR spectrum of dTC-BPSAF, with bulky dendron
substituents, exhibits three species in a range of 6.0−6.8 ppm
with clearly broad spectra full-widths at half-maximum
(fwhm’s) of 0.01 to 0.02 ppm, which are distinctively broader
than those of BPSAF (0.06−0.09 ppm). This suggests that
molecular rotation in dTC-BPSAF is significantly restricted at
room temperature. At 223 K, the
1
H NMR spectrum of dTC-
BPSAF in a range of 6.5−6.8 ppm clearly shows three species
and condensed broad peaks at 6.1−6.3 ppm. These fwhm’s of
peaks of dTC-BPSAF (0.06−0.1 ppm) are significantly broader
than those of BPSAF (0.01−0.02 ppm) at 223 K, indicating
that acceptor dendronization more significantly suppresses
molecular rotation at low temperatures.
Furthermore, upon cooling, the triplet species of dTC-
BPSAF at approximately 6.7 ppm split into three peaks and
undergo a significant upfield shift (Figure 4). The broad peaks
at approximately 6.3 and 6.4 ppm also exhibit an upfield shift
and coalesce into one species at 6.1−6.3 ppm. These upfield-
shifted peaks at low temperatures are assigned to the more
pronounced shielding effect of the electron cloud from nearby
weak-donating dendrons due to intramolecular through-space
interactions.
43
Besides, the reduction of molecular motion at
low temperatures can limit the rotation and vibration of the
nuclei, thereby reducing the influence of local magnetic fields
on the nuclei and causing upfield-shifted peaks. In contrast,
compared with dTC-BPSAF, BPSAF displays very small
upfield-shifted peaks upon cooling (Figure 4), indicating a
smaller reduction in molecular motion and a weaker shielding
effect due to the lack of intramolecular through-space
interactions. These results demonstrate that acceptor dendro-
nization significantly restricts molecular rotation and increases
intramolecular through-space interactions.
Photoluminescence Behaviors in the Aggregate
State and OLED Devices. To investigate the RTP properties
from solution to aggregate states, the PL properties of dTC-
BPSAF in a dilute THF/water solution were measured (Figure
S29 and Table S1). The PL intensity of dTC-BPSAF exhibits a
significant increase with the addition of water to fractions ( f
w
)
of 90%, indicating a pronounced aggregation-induced emission
(AIE)
45
phenomenon. Concurrently, the phosphorescence
lifetimes also exhibit a substantial increase from 3.2 to 28.0
ms with an increasing degree of aggregation, indicating
aggregation-induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)
46
behaviors. Therefore, the PLQY of dTC-BPSAF is 34% in
solution and sharply increases to 63% in neat films (Figure 5a
and Figure S30 and Table S2). These results indicate that
restricted intramolecular motion caused by aggregation can
largely block the nonradiative pathways and further improve
RTP efficiency.
To fabricate the OLED devices, the PL properties of doped
host films were investigated. Their prompt and delayed PL
spectra of the doped host, 10-(4-((4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-
phenyl)sulfonyl)phenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine
(CzAcSF)
47
at 10 wt % in films, exhibit PL emissions at 481
nm and phosphorescence emission at 483 nm for dTC-BPSAF,
with a small ΔE
ST
of 0.02 eV at room temperature (Figures
S31 and S32 and Table S2). Moreover, the k
ISC
of 2.07 × 10
7
s
−1
for dTC-BPSAF in doped films is significantly higher than
that of BPSAF (1.4 × 10
6
s
−1
),
31
resulting in a high k
P
of 36.0
s
−1
for dTC-BPSAF, which indicates the successful realization
of efficient RTP emission in doped films through the acceptor
dendronization strategy. Consequently, the PLQY of dTC-
BPSAF doped film reaches up to 98% (Figure 5a), highlighting
their significant potential for the fabrication of efficient RTP-
OLEDs.
In the realm of RTP-OLEDs, several significant challenges
persist, hindering their advancement.
6
These obstacles include
the low PLQY in amorphous films, inferior EQE of the devices,
unstable electroluminescence spectra,
20
and limited molecular

design strategies. These factors collectively impede the
development of efficient and color-stable RTP-OLEDs.
Specifically, the development of high-efficiency sky-blue RTP
materials has been fundamentally constrained by the large
ΔE
ST
in conventional systems, which induces significant
emission redshift and compromises sky-blue emission purity.
In this work, the RTP-OLED devices were fabricated by spin-
coating and vacuum evaporation with a configuration of
indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PE-
DOT:PSS) (70 nm)/10-(4-((4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-
sulfonyl)phenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine
(CzAcSF):dTC-BPSAF (90:10, EML, 40 nm)/bis[2-
(diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether oxide (DPEPO) (10
nm)/1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-ylphenyl)benzene (TmPyPB) (50
nm)/ lithium fluoride (LiF) (1 nm)/ aluminum (Al) (100
nm) (Figure 5b). Among them, PEDOT:PSS and the emission
layer were prepared by spin coating, while other layers were
prepared by vacuum deposition. Detailed device data are
shown in Figure 5c,d, and in Table S3. The fabricated devices
exhibit sky-blue electroluminescence (EL) with a peak
wavelength of 492 nm with CIE color coordinates of (0.18,
0.36). These values are slightly redshifted compared with the
PL spectra in doped films. Notably, the EL spectra remained
remarkably stable at different voltages, owing to the small ΔE
ST
and near-complete overlap of fluorescence and phosphor-
escence spectra. This innovative acceptor dendronization
strategy overcomes the critical redshift limitation in conven-
tional sky-blue RTP-OLEDs. The devices achieve a high
maximum current efficiency (CE) of 59.5 cd/A, a maximum
power efficiency (PE) of 33.9 lm/W, and a maximum EQE of
25.1% (Figure S33). These results exceed the current state-of-
the-art performance for any reported solution-processed RTP-
OLED devices
23,24,48−53
(Figure 5d). Considering that the
light out-coupling efficiency of the conventional OLEDs is 20−
30%, the abovementioned devices can achieve almost a unit
exciton utilization rate. In addition, Figures S34−S37 and
Tables S3−S5 provide further information about devices with
different structures. Among them, the solution-processed
TADF-OLED based on BPSAF exhibits an EQE of 22.4%,
which is worse than the performance of RTP dendrimer
devices. These results indicates that the acceptor dendroniza-
tion strategy can not only transfer the luminescence
mechanism from TADF to RTP but also increase the device
efficiency due to the reduction of nonradiative transitions.
Similarly, in their nondoped device, dTC-BPSAF also shows
better efficiency. Hence, the acceptor dendronization design
strategy exhibits the significant potential to enhance the
efficiency of RTP-OLEDs.
■
CONCLUSIONS
By employing our developed acceptor dendronization strategy,
we have successfully achieved a series of significant advance-
ments: (i) we have proposed a clear design rule for RTP
materials at the single-molecule level and thoroughly
elucidated the mechanism from facilitating ISC, boosting
triplet radiation to suppressing molecular motions to achieve
efficient RTP; (ii) we have developed a new type of RTP
material�RTP dendrimers�and provided a theoretical basis
for the development of high-performance RTP dendrimers;
(iii) we have simultaneously achieved ultrastable RTP with a
lifetime of 1.55 ms in ambient solution, efficient RTP films
with PLQY of 98%, and state-of-art solution-processed RTP-
OLEDs with an EQE
max
of 25.1%. This breakthrough was
made possible by transforming small TADF molecules into
RTP dendrimers through acceptor dendronization. First, the
increased splitting of triplet energy levels generates more ISC
channels and enhances the ISC process. Second, introducing
electron-donating dendrons into the acceptor helps to increase
hole distributions within the acceptor, leading to enhanced

A
characteristics and
3
(n, π*) transitions and significantly
boosting the SOC (T
1
, S

) and μ
T d

→S d
0
. Third, the acceptor
dendronization dendrimer exhibits multiple molecular inter-
actions that construct a rigid dendronized structure, which
restricts molecular motion and stabilized triplet excitons,
leading to a reduction in nonradiative transitions. Therefore,
these crucial advantages, originating from acceptor dendroni-
zation, collectively lead to efficient RTP emissions in both
solution and solid states, providing clear guidance for
molecular design in the RTP field. Consequently, our research
contributes to a deep understanding of how to regulate excited
state properties and molecular motion in molecular systems to
achieve efficient RTP, opening new perspectives for the
development of advanced materials in the field of optoelec-
tronics.
