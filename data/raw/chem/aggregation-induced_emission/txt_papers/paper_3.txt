ABSTRACT: New agents with particular speci ﬁcity toward targeted
bacteria and supere ﬃ cacy in antibacterial activity are urgently needed in
facing the crisis of worldwide antibiotic resistance. Herein, a novel strategy
by equipping bacteriophage (PAP) with photodynamic inactivation (PDI)-
active AIEgens (luminogens with aggregation-induced emission property)
was presented to generate a type of AIE −PAP bioconjugate with superior
capability for both targeted imaging and synergistic killing of certain
species of bacteria. The targeting ability inherited from the bacteriophage
enabled the bioconjugates to speci ﬁcally recognize the host bacteria with
preserved infection activity of phage itself. Meanwhile, the AIE
characteristic empowered them a monitoring functionality, and the real-
time tracking of their interactions with targets was therefore realized via
convenient ﬂuorescence imaging. More importantly, the PDI-active AIEgens could serve as powerful in situ photosensitizers
producing high-eﬃ ciency reactive oxygen species (ROS) under white light irradiation. As a result, selective targeting and synergistic
killing of both antibiotic-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were successfully achieved in in vitro and in vivo
antibacterial tests with excellent biocompatibility. This novel AIE −phage integrated strategy would diversify the existing pool of
antibacterial agents and inspire the development of promising drug candidates in the future.
■ INTRODUCTION
Bacterial infectious diseases have become one of the greatest
global challenges, which seriously threaten the health and
civilization of human beings,
1,2 and increasing evidence revealed
that bacteria can also indirectly promote the occurrence and
progression of other diseases, such as cancer.
3−6 On the other
hand, bacterial communities are indispensable to human health,
such as intestinal microbes whose balances determined the
nutrient absorption from digested food in our bodies and should
be always protected from unintentional damage.
7,8 Therefore, in
the antibacterial battle, promoting an antibacterial agent in
terms of targeting and killing e ﬃ ciency is persistently pursued.
Antibiotics have been predominately employed in the treatment
of bacterial infections since the discovery of penicillin. However,
by use of antibiotics, even narrow-spectrum antibiotics, both
harmful bacteria and bene ﬁcial microbes could be killed,
resulting in side e ﬀects such as diarrhea, constipation, and
inﬂammatory bowels.
9,10 The global abuse or overuse of
antibiotics has promoted bacterial evolution and intensi ﬁed
the antibiotic resistance.11,12 The situation is worsening with the
rapidly increased di ﬃ culty and cost in producing new robust
antibacterial agents. 13 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop
pinpoint accurate drugs to kill certain species of harmful
pathogens. Fortunately, bacteriophage had been veri ﬁed with
particular speci ﬁcity to their hosts
14 and could evolve
synchronously to adapt to infect resistant bacteria. 15,16
Phagotherapy, which was use d before antibiotics were
discovered, is now going through a revival driven by the crisis
of antibiotic resistance.
17 However, the bacteriophage alone
normally shows a moderate antibacterial e ﬀect, hindering the
curing of infectious diseases, especially the acute infections. 18
Because of the lack of imaging moieties, the processes of
phagotherapy including targe t recognition, binding, and
infection could not be easily monitored, resulting in di ﬃ cult
real-time evaluation of therapeutic performance. The introduc-
tion of sensitively detectable “radar” with powerful “weaponry”
will therefore promote phagotherapy as a deluxe ensemble for
both visualization of its infection process and their subsequent
discriminative eradication.
Fluorescence imaging technology has emerged as a rapid,
facile, and powerful tool for visualization and tracking of
bioanalytes with merits of high sensitivity, low cost, and fast

responsiveness. 19−21 Surpassing traditional organic ﬂuoro-
phores that have usually su ﬀered severe photobleaching and
moderate signal-to-noise ratio, the newly developed luminogens
with aggregation-induced emission characteristics (AIEgens)
are becoming attractive candidates for advanced biosensing and
imaging application.
22−25 AIEgens display weak emission in
solution but intensi ﬁed ﬂuorescence upon aggregation via the
restriction of intramolecular motion. 26 The unique light-up
ﬂuorescence with negligible background noise and remarkable
photostability qualiﬁes AIEgens to be a superior choice in long-
lasting ﬂuorescence imaging and tracking for dynamic
bioprocesses.27−29 What is more, with intelligent molecular
designing, AIE-based materials display exceptional photo-
dynamic activity for the treatments of malignant cancer and
the inactivation of bacteria.
30−34 However, the speci ﬁc
discrimination of a certain species of bacterium has not yet
been previously demonstrated by AIEgens, making them
unsuitable for accurately removing certain targeted bacte-
rium.
35,36 Although the bioorthogonal method showed improve-
ment in targeted labeling, the incorporation of exogenous
reactive groups was demanding with challenges for large-scale
applications.
37,38 These limitations propelled us to engineer
AIEgens with pinpoint speci ﬁcity to realize the discriminative
imaging and killing of a certain species of bacterium.
Herein, a novel strategy was presented by integrating AIEgens
with bacteriophage to form a new class of antimicrobial
bioconjugates (TVP −PAP) for the imaging and killing of a
certain species of bacterium ( Scheme 1 ). Phage targeting
P. aeruginosa was chosen as a prototype. The AIE molecule,
TVP-S, was designed with excellent ﬂuorescence properties and
eﬃ cient PDI activity. Through a simple amino −carboxyl
reaction, the AIEgens could be facilely modi ﬁed onto the
surface of phage entity. The generated TVP −PAP perfectly
preserved the properties of both AIEgen and phage, with
intrinsic AIE ﬂuorescence serving the function of real-time
monitoring of phage −bacterium interaction and particular
speciﬁcity in bacterial targeting. What is more, the synergistic
antibacterial e ﬀect with e ﬃ ciency that signi ﬁcantly surpassing
both individuals in the bioconjugates was achieved by
integrating the PDI activity of AIEgen and the infection ability
of phage itself. Superior performance of the bioconjugate was
also demonstrated in in vivo treatment of infectious wounds
caused by both antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P. aeruginosa. This
novel strategy by integrating speci ﬁc targeting, discriminative
imaging, and synergistic killing functionalities together into an
AIE−phage bioconjugate is a promising methodology for the
design of next-generation antibacterial agents.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
AIEgen Synthesis, Property Characterizations, and
Bioconjugation with Bacteriophage. The AIE compound
TVP-S was designed and synthesized through three-step
reactions ( Figure 1 aa n d Figure S1 ). Its structure was
determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high
resolution mass spectroscopy, and X-ray di ﬀraction (XRD,
Figure S2) as shown in the Supporting Information. Attributed
to the existence of a positively charged pyridinium group and the
hydrophilic carboxyl group in its structure, TVP-S could be well
dissolved in a high-polarity solvent including water. More
importantly, the activated carboxyl group in TVP-S structure
endows it capability to straightforwardly react with the amino
group that is widespread in the bioorganism. The obvious
absorbance of TVP-S in the range between 400 and 600 nm with
a maximum at 457 nm showed its strong capability of visible
light absorption ( Figure 1b). As TVP-S could be well dissolved
in solvent with large polarity, we investigated its AIE features in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/chloroform (CHCl 3) mixtures via
varying the fractions of CHCl 3. As shown in Figure 1c, TVP-S
exhibited an apparent AIE property. Fluorescence could hardly
be observed when it was dissolved in a good solvent, DMSO,
whereas strong aggregated- state emission with 47 times
enhancement in intensity appeared when the fraction of
chloroform reached 99% ( Figure 1 d). Their maximum
emissions in the aggregation state are located at 630 nm,
indicating its long-wavelength emission properties and large
Stokes shifts. The signi ﬁcant increase in the absolute
ﬂuorescence quantum yield of TVP-S in chloroform (33.3%)
versus in DMSO (1.6%) further veri ﬁed its typical AIE feature.

BSA and bacteria could also induce the aggregation of TVP-S in
aqueous solution with signi ﬁcant emission enhancements
(Figures S3 and S4 ). Moreover, dynamic light scattering
(DLS) analysis was performed to con ﬁrm the aggregation
process by decreasing the solvent polarity, with obvious
increases in the average hydrodynamic diameters ( Figure S5).
The strong absorption of TVP-S in the visible light region
could lead to the utilization of white light as the source for PDI-
based antibacterial application. The ROS generation e ﬃ ciency
of TVP-S was initially determined by using of 2 ′,7′-
dichloroﬂuorescin diacetate (DCFH) as indicator, which
could emit ﬂuorescence with a “turn-on” process triggered by
ROS. As depicted in Figure S6, DCFH alone was nonemissive
and remained almost constant during 10 min white light
irradiation (∼4.2 mW cm
−2). In contrast, the emission intensity
of DCFH gradually increased and reached 23-fold within the
same period exposure to white light irradiation in the presence of
TVP-S. In addition, up to 72.3% of singlet oxygen ( 1O2)
quantum yield for TVP-S was determined by using 9,10-
anthracenediylbis(methylene)dimalonic acid (ABDA) as an
indicator and Rose Bengal (RB) as a standard with ∼75%
quantum yield for
1O2
39,40 (Figure 1e,f and Figure S7). Sodium
azide (NaN 3)a sa 1O2 quencher41 was further added to the
ABDA solution in the presence of TVP-S. As shown inFigure S8,
the decomposition rate of ABDA slowed down gradually with
increase of the concentration of NaN
3, and 2.0 mg/mL NaN 3
could completely inhibited the decomposition of ABDA,
implying
1O2 was indeed generated by TVP-S. Meanwhile, no
obvious enhancements could be observed in the signal from the
hydroxyphenyl ﬂuorescein (HBF) indicator for hydroxyl
radicals (OH • ) and the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) indicator
for superoxide radicals (O2
• −), indicating that 1O2 accounted for
nearly all of the ROS generated by TVP-S (Figures S9 and S10).
As the 1O2 should be stemmed from the energy transfer process
between the triplet oxygen and triplet excited-state photo-
sensitizer, we further checked the existence of triplet excitons in
TVP-S. As shown in Figure S11 , TVP-S exhibited strong
phosphorescence emission with a lifetime of up to 31.3 μsa t7 7
K, clearly demonstrating its eﬃ cient intersystem crossing (ISC)
to the triplet excited state. Theoretically, this is also quite
rational given TVP-S contains a Br atom which usually boosts
the ISC process in organic molecular systems (the well-known
heavy atom e ﬀect
42).
With the activated carboxyl group in its molecular structure,
TVP-S could facilely react with the amino group in the outside
proteins of bacteriophage and was ready to form the AIE-
featured phage bioconjugate (TVP −PAP). As illustrated in
Figure 2a, the intensiﬁed absorbance of PAP phage in the range
400−500 nm after AIEgen modi ﬁcation con ﬁrmed the
successful bioconjugation reaction between TVP-S and PAP.
According to concentration titrations, the molar extinction
coeﬃ cients of TVP-S and PAP were calculated to be 1.94 × 10
4
and 3.41 × 1010 M−1 cm−1, respectively (Figure 2b,c and Figure
S12). The molar ratio of TVP-S to PAP in the TVP −PAP
bioconjugate was determined to be on average 8200 AIEgen
molecules bound on one PAP entity, according to the enhanced
absorbance at 457 nm of TVP −PAP compared to bare PAP.
Because of the robust ROS generation capability of prepared
AIE-phage bioconjugates ( Figure S13 ), the particular bacterial
recognition, real-time tracking, and synergistic bacterial killing
were highly expectable ( Figure 2d).
Particularly Speci ﬁc Bacteria Imaging by TVP −PAP.
Taking advantage of the speci ﬁc recognition feature of phage
and the unique AIE property from TVP-S, the e ﬃ ciency of
bacterial imaging using TVP −PAP was ﬁrst examined on its
target bacteria ( P. aeruginosa ). As shown in Figure 3 a, P.
aeruginosa could be stained with bright ﬂuorescence upon
incubating with TVP −PAP for 30 min, and the staining
eﬃ ciency could reach 100% e ﬃ ciency (also shown in Figure
S14). Compared to the commercial cell membrane staining dye,
DiO, P. aeruginosa could be light-up stained by the TVP −PAP
probe with a much higher staining e ﬃ ciency (Figure S15). To
test the particular speciﬁcity of this TVP−PAP probe stemming
from the inherent recognition capability of bacteriophage, we
employed two types of bacteria, G
− A. baumannii (Figure S16)
and G+ S. aureus (Figure S17), as controls. The results showed
that even for the process extending to 60 min, neither bacteria
could be stained by TVP −PAP probes, and no apparent
ﬂuorescence signals emitted out from either of them in the AIE
ﬂuorescence channel.
Encouraged by this exciting result, we further conducted real-
time tracking of the bacterial staining process in the mixed
microbes including A. baumannii (G
−) and host bacteria P.
aeruginosa (G−) to verify the particular selectivity of the TVP −
PAP probe to its targetP. aeruginosa. Clearly, the arrow indicated
A. baumannii could never be stained throughout the whole

incubation process by monitoring both the bright- ﬁeld pictures
and the ﬂuorescence images as shown in Figure 3b. In contrast,
the recognition and attachment between TVP −PAP and P.
aeruginosa started after 10 min coincubation to emit out a
ﬂuorescence signal. With the time elapsing to 30 min, the
ﬂuorescence signal became gradually stronger, and more
detailed tracking of TVP −PAP was also carried out, in which
the ﬂuorescence signal of bacteria intensi ﬁed to a platform after
30 min, consistent with the necessary time for phage targeted
binding and infection to the host ( Figure S18). These results of
nearly all P. aeruginosa being successfully stained while no
ﬂuorescence being observed from A. baumannii demonstrated
the particular speci ﬁcity of TVP −PAP probe to its target
bacteria. The use of AIEgen alone for bacterial imaging via
nonspeciﬁc electrostatic or hydrophobic −hydrophobic inter-
action indicated that it is impossible to realize the absolute
discrimination of a certain species of bacterium. 31 The stable
and eﬃ cient staining of G − bacteria was always challenged due
to the blocking of their complicated cell walls. 43,44 The
introduction of bacteriophage could guide AIEgen to realize
discriminative light-up imaging likely equipped with a sensing
“radar”. The TVP−PAP carried AIEgen to anchor and aggregate
on the surface of target bacteria, resulting in the enrichment of a
large number of AIEgens at local site with enhancement in their
ﬂuorescence emission for light-up imaging of bacteria. There-
fore, signi ﬁcant advancement in targeting speci ﬁcity could be
achieved by the TVP −PAP bioconjugate compared to the
previous AIEgens that su ﬀered moderate selectivity.

Targeted Antibacterial E ﬀect via Phage-Guided
Photodynamic Inactivation. Inspired by the exceptional
bacteria-targeting ability of PAP and high 1O2 generation
eﬃ ciency of AIEgens, we next checked their synergistic

antibacterial performances in facing antibiotic-sensitive and
MDR P. aeruginosa . The times for incubation and white light
illumination were ﬁrst optimized by examining the survival rate
of P. aeruginosa . To avoid the instant decrease of bacterial
survival rate, a small amount of TVP −PAP (9.54 × 105 PFU
mL−1) was added in each group. As shown in Figure S19, with
elongation of the incubation time from 0 to 30 min, the bacterial
survival rate decreased from 98.3% to 74.7%, consistent with the
saturation time in the above imaging process (Figure S18). Next,
we ﬁxed the incubation time at 30 min and then irradiated the
bacterial suspensions by white light (4.2 mW cm
−2) for 2, 10, 30,
and 60 min. Nearly 79% of P. aeruginosa could be eradicated
after 30 min illumination, and the e ﬃ cacy remained unchanged
even upon irradiation prolonged to 60 min, indicating the
saturation of ROS generation at this condition. Furthermore, the
bacterial survival rate signi ﬁcantly increased after reversing the
sequence of incubation and illumination, suggesting the critical
role of phage targeting and infection before TVP −PAP-guided
ROS generation on the bacterial surface ( Figure S20 ). Thus,
light illumination following 30 min coincubation was applied in
the subsequent antibacterial tests.
The synergistic antibacterial e ﬀect of TVP −PAP was next
tested by comparing with the same molar concentrations of
individual AIEgen and PAP entity. As shown in Figure 4 a, for
antibiotic-sensitive P. aeruginosa, neither incubation in darkness
(control I-30 and control I-60) nor with further white light
irradiation (control I-30 and L-30) could pose an apparent
inﬂuence on the bacterial survival rate. Similarly, TVP-S alone
could neither inhibit the bacterial growth crossing the tested
concentration range (4.33−21.65 pM, according to the 3.18:1−
15.9:1 molar ratio), no matter with or without light irradiation. It
was possible that the nonspeci ﬁc AIEgens and their relative low
concentration on the surface of bacteria weakened the
destructive e ﬀect. In contrast, upon PAP treatment, the
antibacterial e ﬀect initiated when its concentration increased
to 9.54 × 10
5 PFU mL−1 (according to the 9.54:1 molar ratio)
under darkness (PAP I-60). The bacterial survival rate further
decreased to 48.3% when the concentration increased to 15.9 ×
105 PFU mL−1 (according to the 15.9:1 molar ratio) in a dose-
dependent manner. This result indicated the inherited infection
capability of the TVP−PAP bioconjugate from the PAP moiety.
With assistance from AIEgen, TVP −PAP showed a slightly
higher antibacterial eﬃ ciency in the darkness compared to PAP
alone (TVP −PAP I-30 vs PAP I-30) crossing the tested
concentration range, possibly contributed by the dark toxicity of
the AIEgens enriched on the surface of P. aeruginosa . Upon
elongating the interaction time for another 30 min (TVP −PAP
I-60), this dark toxicity became much stronger and could cause
another 20% decrease in the bacterial survival rate at the
concentration of 9.54 × 10
5 PFU mL −1. Furthermore, by
harnessing the extra PDI activity under white light irradiation,
we could observe signi ﬁcant enhancements in the antibacterial
eﬃ ciency (TVP−PAP I-30 and L-30). With the concentration of
TVP−PAP increasing to 1.59 × 10
6 PFU mL −1, the bacteria
survival rate rapidly decreased to 6.9%. The agar plate pictures
also veri ﬁed the excellent antibacterial e ﬀect from TVP −PAP
bioconjugates which was much superior to TVP-S and PAP
alone (Figure S21), and complete inhibition could be achieved

light). The concentration of TVP−PAP was determined by using PAP as the standard, and the concentration of TVP-S was calculated according to the
molar ratio of TVP-S to PAP in TVP −PAP bioconjugate. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

by increasing TVP−PAP to 2.544 × 106 PFU mL−1 (Figures S22
and S23). PAP could keep an infectious capability after TVP-S
modiﬁcation for at least 1 week ( Figures S24 and S25 ).
Extending to the clinical isolated MDR P. aeruginosa, a similar
dose-dependent antibacterial proﬁle was presented upon TVP−
PAP treatment. When the concentration of TVP−PAP increases
to 6.36 × 107 PFU mL−1, the eradication e ﬃ ciency could reach
64.8% (TVP−PAP I-60), and the eﬃ ciency could even rise up to
99.5% under white light irradiation (TVP−PAP I-30 and L-30).
In contrast, at the same concentration, the individual AIEgen
(TVP-S I30 and L-30) and PAP (PAP I30 and L-30) could only
kill 7.0% and 46.5% bacteria, respectively, deﬁnitely verifying the
signiﬁcantly synergistic antibacterial e ﬀect boosted by the PDI
activity of AIEgens.
The targeted killing is another critical consideration in
antibacterial test. Herein, the character of PAP was introduced
for the bacterial discrimination and their following targeted
killing. This capability of TVP −PAP was checked in two-
component systems by culturing host bacteria, P. aeruginosa
(G
−), with nonhost bacteria, A. baumannii (G−)o r S. aureus
(G+), respectively. As shown in Figure 4b,c, in the presence of
light irradiation, P. aeruginosa was e ﬀectively killed, and few
colonies formed upon TVP−PAP treatment, whereas the colony
quantity of A. baumannii or S. aureus was nearly una ﬀected,
consistent with the above selective staining result of TVP −PAP
to its target. The phage-guided targeting was proposed to play a
critical role in achieving this super-antibacterial performance.
PAP ﬁrst speciﬁcally recognized the antibiotic-sensitive or MDR

TVP−PAP to P. aeruginosa was 15.9:1) for 30 min and irradiated under white light for another 50 min.

P. aeruginosa through its tail protein binding to lipopolysac-
charide of the host bacteria. 14 Then the AIEgens (low to 21.65
pM in 1.59 × 106 PFU mL−1 TVP−PAP) were enriched on the
bacterial surface. Following the infection process of phage itself,
the AIEgens generating e ﬃ cient
1O2 in situ under white light
irradiation could further promote the destruction on the
targeted bacteria. Compared to the previous PDI-based
antibacterial tests demanding up to several micromolar
AIEgens,
36,45−47 our phage-guided method showed a fairly
higher e ﬃ cacy and would remarkably mitigate the toxic
concerns regarding the random interaction of traditional
photosensitizers with the surrounding biomolecules.
Tracking of the Phage-Guided Targeting and Killing
Process. The unique ﬂuorescence property of AIEgen was also
harnessed for real-time monitoring this targeting and killing
process. As shown in Figure 5 , the successful staining of P.
aeruginosa was ﬁrst achieved by incubating with TVP −PAP
bioconjugates, with emitting out robust ﬂuorescence signal
under imaging (also quantitated in Figure S26). After exposure
to white light starting from the time point at 30 min, bacterial
morphologies became gradually blurred with illumination
lasting, with obvious appearance of fragments in the bright
ﬁeld. In the ﬂuorescence ﬁeld, signals disappeared in a large
fraction of bacteria after 10 min irradiation, along with the
apparent agglomeration of bacterial cells. These change in
morphology and ﬂuidity indicated destruction happened on the
targeted bacteria. To MDR P. aeruginosa, the real-time tracking
was performed upon interaction with a higher concentration of
TVP−PAP (6.36 × 10
7 PFU mL −1)( Figure S27 ). Similarly,
after 30 min coincubation, it was easy to observe the bacterial
cell fragment whose amount obviously increased with the
elapsing of white light irradiation time, indicating the
aggravating damage to the MDR bacteria.

To gain more insights into the antibacterial e ﬀect of TVP −
PAP, SEM imaging was employed to monitor the morphological
changes on antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P. aeruginosa .A s
shown in Figure 6a, without TVP−PAP treatment, P. aeruginosa
possessed a smooth surface with an intact cell wall and well-
stereo-shaped body. In contrast, after treatment with TVP−PAP
and white light irradiation, the cell walls of P. aeruginosa
apparently became rough and even ruptured with the
disappearance of its original stereo shape.
Also, numerous holes appeared on the bacterial surface. These
holes punched by phage would accelerate the permeation of 1O2
into the bacteria cytoplasm and caused further damages to P.
aeruginosa (Figure 6b). A similar result with coarse cell surfaces
and collapsed morphologies could also be observed in the case of
MDR P. aeruginosa, verifying the tremendous destruction from
the synergistic e ﬀect
48,49 of TVP −PAP bioconjugates ( Figure
S28).
In Vivo Synergistic Eradication of Skin Infections.
Inspired by the outstanding bacteria targeting and elimination
activity of TVP−PAP in vitro, we further extended antibacterial
examinations to in vivo using a mouse model with antibiotic-
sensitive or MDR P. aeruginosa infectious skin wounds. The
biocompatibility of TVP−PAP on normal cells wasﬁrst checked.
As illustrated in Figure S29 , for both dark and illumination
groups, the viability of HaCaT cells still remained up to 83%
even the TVP−PAP concentration went up to 8.45 × 10
10 PFU
mL−1. The imaging result of HaCaT cell incubated with TVP −
PAP further veri ﬁed its low toxicity as no obvious ﬂuorescence
signal could be detected ( Figure S30). Compared to the TVP-S
molecules, the improved biocompatibility of TVP −PAP
provided a basis for their in vivo antibacterial application
(Figure S31).
After model building, the antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P.
aeruginosa infected mice were randomly separated into three
groups with various treatments (as depicted in Figure 7 a).
Through monitoring the healing processes of the wounds, it was
clear that the mice treated with TVP−PAP nearly recovered at 8
day post-treatment ( Figure 7 b,d). Both of the relative wound
sizes infected by antibiotic-sensitive and MDR P. aeruginosa
decreased to below 10%, signi ﬁcantly smaller compared to the
PBS control or TVP −PAP alone group ( Figure 7 c,e). The
wound healing was much faster than the previous reports using
AIE polymer
32 and an AIEgen−antibiotic conjugate in the case
of G− bacterial infection,45 demonstrating the supereﬃ ciency of
the phage-guided bacterial killing. The infected skin tissues were
then collected, and bacterial colony numbers were counted to
quantify the antibacterial e ﬃ cacy of TVP −PAP. It turned out
that both numbers of bacteria in the groups treated with TVP −
PAP plus white light irradiation were much smaller comparing to
the PBS control and TVP −PAP alone treated group ( Figure
S32). The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining also proved
the superior outcome of TVP −PAP treatment plus white light
irradiation by showing intact histological characteristics. Where-
as in control and TVP−PAP treated alone, invaded lymphocytes
could be obviously observed ( Figure 8 ). Collectively, these
outstanding performances in vivo suggested the great potential
of TVP−PAP bioconjugates in the application of target bacterial
killing and infectious disease therapeutics.
■ CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we proposed a novel antibacterial strategy by
integrating the ﬂuorescence monitoring, phage targeting, and
AIE-based photodynamic inactivation together toward a certain
species of bacterium. Bene ﬁting from the unique ﬂuorescence
property, eﬀective
1O2 generation capability, particular targeting
speciﬁcity, TVP −PAP had been successfully utilized in the
discriminative imaging, selective and e ﬃ cient killing of targeted
bacteria, without apparent inﬂuence in the nontargeting bacteria
or the normal mammalian cells. The in vitro test demonstrated
that even MDR P. aeruginosa could be killed with nearly 100%
eﬃ ciency attributing to the synergistic e ﬀect within TVP−PAP.
Additionally, in vivo study veriﬁed that the healing rates of both
antibiotic-sensitive and MDR bacteria infected wound could be
signiﬁcantly accelerated. These remarkable performances
validated that the superior potential of TVP −PAP bioconjugate
in synergistic bacterial recognizing and killing that surpassing
each individual component within the bioconjugate. Through
changing to other phages, this AIE-phage conjugated strategy

could be extended to be a universal approach for producing
particular speciﬁc antibacterial agents, holding great potential to
the treatment of bacterial infections as well as diseases indirectly
inﬂuenced by bacteria, such as the chemo- or immunotherapy
resistant cancer with critical bacterial participation.
