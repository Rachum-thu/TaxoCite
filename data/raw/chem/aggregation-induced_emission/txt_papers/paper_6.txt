Abstract: We reported an efficient multicomponent polyannu-
lation for in situ generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched
polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and
low-cost, commercially available arylnitriles,N aSbF6,a nd
H2O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields
(up to 99 %) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw
up to 1.011 X 106)a nd lowp olydispersity indices.T he resulting
polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields
with tunable emission in the solid state,m aking them ideal
materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning.
These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong
ability to generate reactive oxygen species,w hich allowed their
applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable
photodynamic patterning of living organisms in as imple and
cost-effective way.
Introduction
Polyelectrolytes,s uch as DNA, RNA, and proteins,a re
widespread in natural living systems,a nd possess biological
properties and multiple charges to interact with oppositely
charged species via electrostatic attraction.[1] Among various
natural polyelectrolytes,p olysaccharides are the largest
component of biomass,e xemplified by av ariety of hyper-
branched species,[2] such as amylopectin,[3] glycogen,[4] arabi-
noxylan,[5] xanthan gum,[6] and PTR-EPS1.[7] In general, these
hyperbranched polysaccharides are rich in hydroxyl groups,
while some of them contain additional amino groups,c arboxyl
groups,a nd sulfonate groups,w hich can be ionized under
certain conditions to become hyperbranched polyelectrolytes
to fulfill certain biological functions.D espite hyperbranched
polyelectrolytes play ap ivotal role in organisms,t heir exact
chemical structures are hardly identified due to the structural
complexity.[2] In addition, the contents of some species are low
in nature.[7] Thus,u nderstanding their detailed formation
mechanisms and biological functions becomes difficult. In this
regard, synthetic polymers can serve as largely accessible
substitutes to mimic the structures and functions of biomac-
romolecules.[8] It is thus of great importance to design and
synthesize novel hyperbranched polyelectrolytes and explore
their potential applications.
Owing to the limited synthetic approach, the research
progress of hyperbranched polyelectrolytes is stagnant.
Typically,h yperbranched polymers are synthesized via the
polycondensation of AB2 monomers,[9] which lack chemical
stability,r equire nontrivial synthetic efforts,a nd suffer from
unsatisfactory functionality.[10] Another most widely used
method is the copolymerization of A3 and B2 monomers,[11]

which generally requires strictly controlled conditions to
avoid gelation, large dispersity (Y), and/or the formation of
oligomeric products.[12] On the other hand, the main strategy
for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes is the post-modification
of nonionic polymers,[13] which is hard to achieve 100 %
conversion efficiencya nd leaves patches along the polymer
chains.S ome coupling reactions (e.g.,H eck and Sonogashira)
are also employed for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes,b ut
they typically require expensive ionic monomers.[14] Besides,
the aforementioned polymerizations are one or two-compo-
nent systems,w hich greatly restrict the structural and func-
tional diversity of polymers.I nc ontrast with these “few-
body” systems,t he “many-body” systems are commonly
adopted by natural polymerizations because the permutations
and combinations of multiple components can bring in rich
biodiversity and infinite possibilities.[15] As such, it is essential
to develop multicomponent polymerizations for the facile
synthesis of hyperbranched polyelectrolytes from stable
monomers.
Thed evelopment of novel hyperbranched polyelectro-
lytes with unique structures and multifunctionalities is still in
strong demand. Although many hyperbranched polyelectro-
lytes have been studied during the past several decades,[16]
most of them are commodity polymers with aliphatic back-
bones and no advanced functionalities.[17] In addition, the
investigation of aromatic hyperbranched polymers often
suffers from low molecular weight, poor processability,a nd
poor solubility due to p–p stacking, which discourage their
real-world applications.I nt his regard, the introduction of
positively charged heteroaromatic fused rings into the hyper-
branched polymers can probably address these issues and
provide more opportunities.O nt he one hand, the hetero-
aromatic fused rings can endow the polymers with unique
photophysical properties.S ince the positively charged heter-
oaromatic rings are highly electron-deficient, they can act as
appropriate donors to facilitate the formation of donor-
acceptor (D-A) structures to tune the emission wavelength of
polymers.O nt he other hand, the charges on the aromatic
rings also help suppress intermolecular and/or intramolecular
p–p stacking[18] to increase the solubility and processibility of
polymers.
Theh eteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes with
unique physiochemical properties are expected to open new
frontiers in their applications.O nt he one hand, the compact
hyperbranched structure helps rigidify the luminescent units,
which impedes the nonradiative decay by restricting intra-
molecular motions to result in fluorescent emission and
intersystem crossing (ISC).[19] Such polymers are anticipated
to show high fluorescence quantum yields desired for
fluorescence imaging.[20] On the other hand, the polymers
may undergo efficient ISC to al ong-lived T1 state and interact
with adjacent triplet oxygen to produce reactive oxygen
species (ROS)f or photodynamic therapy (PDT).[21] Further,
given the high charge density in the backbone,t hese polymers
may exhibit affinity to negatively charged species in biological
systems,s uch as DNAa nd bacterial membrane.[14,2 2] Besides,
due to the eco-friendly and non-invasive attributes as well as
the high spatiotemporal resolution of light,[23] PDT is promis-
ing for the precise patterning of living organisms,w hich offer
an opportunity to build various kinds of bio-architectures in
ac ost-efficient way.
Herein, we developed af our-component (AB2 + C2 + D +
E), seven-functional group polymerization approach, in
which low-cost, commercially available arylnitriles and read-
ily accessible internal diynes were reacted via rhodium(III)-
catalyzed three-fold C@Ha ctivation in the presence of
NaSbF6 and H2O/acetic acid (AcOH) to in situ generate
heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes
(Scheme 1).[24] These polymers were generated in excellent
yields (up to 99 %) with extraordinary high molecular weights
(Mw up to 1.011 X 106)a nd low Y values.S urprisingly,t hese
hyperbranched polyelectrolytes were luminescent in the solid
state with tunable emission wavelength, high quantum yield,
and good processibility,w hich made them ideal materials for
fluorescent photopatterning.B ecause of their net positive
charges and strong ROSg eneration ability,t hese polymers
could serve as effective photosensitizers for photodynamic
killing of bacteria. More interestingly,w e, for the first time,

achieved the photodynamic patterning of living organisms in
ac ustomizable fashion and investigated the dynamic changes
of the resulting biopatterns.
Results and Discussion
All monomers used in this work were easily acquired and
chemically stable under ambient conditions.A rylnitriles 1a –
g,s odium hexafluoroantimonate(V) (NaSbF6), and AcOH
were low-cost and commercially available,a nd were directly
used without further purification. Thei nternal diynes 2a –c
involved in this work were facilely synthesized in high yields
according to the previously reported procedures (Supporting
Information, Scheme S1).[25] All polymerizations were cata-
lyzed by [Cp*RhCl2]2,A g2O, and AgSbF6 in ao ne-pot
manner.
To obtain soluble hyperbranched polyelectrolytes in high
yields and high molecular weights,w es ystematically inves-
tigated the polymerization conditions using 1a , 2a ,N aSbF6,
and AcOH/H2Oa sm onomers.S everal key reaction param-
eters were set as variables to examine their impacts on the
resulting polymers,i ncluding solvent type,m onomer concen-
tration, monomer ratio,c atalyst loading,r eaction atmosphere,
and reaction time (Table 1). Thee ffect of solvents on the
polymerization was first studied (Table 1, entries 1–3). By
comparing the polymerization reactions in 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and dichloromethane/
methanol (DCM/MeOH, v/v,1 /1), the best result was
obtained in pure DCE, which gave ap olymer with aw eight-
average molecular weight (Mw)o f2 60 600 in 57 %y ield
(entry 1). Increasing the concentration of 2a from 50 to
100 mM led to as harp decrease in both Mw and yield due to
the incomplete dissolution of 2a (entry 4). However,w hen
the concentration of 2a was decreased from 50 to 30 mM, the
polymerization proceeded smoothly without gel formation
even when the reaction time was extended from 12 to 18 h,
affording ap olymer with Mw of 231 400 in 84 %y ield
(entry 5). It was found that the monomer ratio and catalyst
loading also played crucial roles in the polymerization
(entries 5–9). When the theoretical monomer loading ratio
of [1a ]:[2a ] = 3:2w as adopted, ap olymer with ah igh Mw was
obtained in ah igh yield (entry 5). However,f urther increasing
the amount of arylnitrile 1a or internal diyne 2a led to as harp
decrease in yield (entries 6–7). On the other hand, decreasing
the loading of [Cp*RhCl2]2 from 10 to 5% mol afforded
ap olymer with ah igher Mw in ah igher yield (entry 8).
However,b oth Mw and yield were sharply decreased by
further reducing the amount of [Cp*RhCl2]2 (entry 9). The
polymerization could also proceed in air without inert gas
protection, affording ap olymer with Mw of 29 700 in 61 %
yield (entry 10). At ime of 18 hw as eventually adopted as the
optimal reaction time,a sp rolonging the reaction time to 24 h
did not give rise to much higher Mw and yield (entry 11).
Under the optimized polymerization conditions,d ifferent
arylnitriles and internal diynes were combined to evaluate the
robustness and universality of this polymerization (Table 2),
in which arylnitriles 1a –g possessed substituent groups with
different electron densities and steric hindrance,a nd internal
diynes 2a –c carried rigid conjugated or flexible spacers.A s
shown in Table 2, arylnitriles 1a –g all reacted efficiently with
internal diynes 2a –c to give hyperbranched polyelectrolytes
in excellent yields with high mo-
lecular weights (Mw up to 1.011 X
106). It is noteworthy that, the
molecular weight of ah yper-
branched polymer is often under-
estimated when measured by GPC
using linear polystyrene as as tan-
dard, which is attributed to the
contracted conformation and the
reduced free volume of the glob-
ular hyperbranched polymer.[26] In-
deed, when the molecular weight
of the hyperbranched polyelectro-
lytes were measured by am ultian-
gle laser light-scattering method,
their absolute Mw values were 9–38
times of the polystyrene-calibrated
ones (Table 2, entries 6–9). Sur-

prisingly,a lthough hyperbranched materials synthesized by
conventional polymerization approaches typically exhibited
very broad Y (often exceeding 5–10),[27] the Y values of the
present polymers were all lower than 2.3. Thel ow Y values
were probably caused by the large steric fused rings,w hich
significantly suppressed the random cross-linking and gela-
tion during the polymerization.
Based on the mechanism of ap reviously reported organic
reaction,[24] we proposed ar eaction mechanism for this
multicomponent polyannulation (Scheme S3). Thanks to the
C@Ha ctivation, two C@Hb onds of the arylnitriles served as
the hidden functional groups to participate in the polymer-
ization process,a nd the three-fold C@Ha ctivation/annulation
cascade of monomers allowed the polyelectrolytes to grow in
three directions,r esulting in hyperbranched polyelectrolytes
with eight possible isomers in the chemical structures (Fig-
ure S1).
All the obtained heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelec-
trolytes showed good solubility in commonly used organic
solvents,s uch as DCM, chloroform, DCE, acetone,D MSO,
and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), regardless of their
molecular weights and the size of the fused-ring moieties.
Thet hermal property of these polymers was evaluated by
thermogravimetric analysis.T he decomposition temperature
at 5% weight loss under nitrogen was in the range of 201–
257 88C( Figure S2), suggesting the high thermal stability of the
present polymers.I t is noteworthy that P1d /2a retained more
than 60 %o fi ts initial weight even after heated to 800 88C,
enabling it an ideal ceramic material.
To facilitate the structural characterization of the hyper-
branched polyelectrolytes,m odel compound 3 was prepared
by rhodium(III)-catalyzed cascade annulation of 4-fluoro-
benzonitrile and diphenylacetylene under the same synthetic
conditions for the polymers (Scheme S2), and its spectral
properties were in good accordance with the literature.[24]
Typical FTIR, 1HN MR, 13CN MR, and 19FN MR spectra of
model compound 3,p olymer P1a /2b,a nd its corresponding
monomers 1a and 2b were collected for comparative
illustration. In the FTIR spectra (Figure 1), the C/Ns tretch-
ing vibrations of 1a and the C/Cs tretching vibrations of 2b
occurred at 2233 and 2220 cm@1,r espectively.H owever,t hese
peaks were not observed in the spectra of 3 and P1a /2b.
Meanwhile,n ew peaks associated with the delocalized C=O,
C=N, and Sb-F stretching vibrations emerged in the spectra of
P1a /2b at 1741, 1641, and 657 cm@1,r espectively,i ndicating
the occurrence of the polymerization. Similar observations
were also found in the FTIR spectra of other polymers
(Figure S3 and S4).
The 1HN MR and 13CN MR spectra of monomers 1a and
2b,m odel compound 3 and P1a /2b in CD2Cl2 were compared
and shown in Figure S6. New peaks emerged at d = 7.76 in the
spectra of 3 and P1a /2b,c orresponding to the aromatic
proton absorptions from the newly formed heteroaromatic
fused rings (Figure S6C,D). Besides,t he 13CN MR spectra
further verified our hypothesis on the chemical structure of
the resulting polymer (Figure S6E–H). Thec haracteristic
peak of C/Ni n 1a was not observed in the polymer spectrum,
and, meanwhile,t he intensity of the characteristic C/Cp eak
in 2b was sharply decreased in the polymer spectrum as
ar esult of polyannulation. Instead, the aromatic carbons at
positions “d”resonated at d = 170.69 and 170.71 in the spectra
of 3 and P1a /2b,r espectively.S imilar features were also
observed in the spectra of other polymers (Figure S7–S31),
confirming the successful synthesis of polymers with struc-
tures as shown in Scheme 1. However,t he degree of branch-
ing of the hyperbranched polyelectrolytes was difficult to be
derived from 1H, 13Co r 19FN MR spectra because of the
overlapping of the resonances and broad signals arising from
structural isomerism.
Motivated by the unique heteroaromatic fused-ring
moieties in the molecular structures,w es ystematically
studied the photophysical properties of the model compound
and polymers.T he absorption spectra of the model compound
and polymers in chloroform (10 mM) were shown in Fig-
ure S32. Their maximum absorption peaks were found in the
range of 480–548 nm. By incorporating different substituent
groups to the strong electron-withdrawing heteroaromatic
fused rings,t he maximum emission wavelength of the
polymers could be facilely tuned from 575 to 652 nm (Fig-
ure 2A ). In particular, by introducing tetraphenylethylene
(TPE) into the polymer skeletons,t he resulting polymers
P1a /2a and P1c –e/2a showed aggregation-enhanced emis-
sion. Taking P1e /2a as an example,i ts chloroform solution
fluoresced weakly at 619 nm. Upon the addition of hexane,
an onpolar poor solvent for the polymer,i nto the chloroform
solution, the emission intensity gradually increased accom-
panied with as light blueshift in the emission maximum to
612 nm (Figure 2B and Figure S33). We further examined the
solid fluorescence of the as-synthesized model compound and
polymers.T he emission of 3 and P1/2 powders covered the
spectral range from yellow,o range,a nd red to deep red with
ag radual shift in maximum emission wavelength from 570 to
finally 662 nm (Figure 2C and Figure S34). In general, the
synthesis of conventional red/deep red luminogens require
tedious synthetic steps because of the inclusion of p-

conjugated macrocyclic units.I na ddition, the resulting
polymers often suffer from aggregation-caused quenching to
result in al ow quantum yield in the solid state.[28] Notably,t he
thin films of P1/2 showed high photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) of up to 14.3 %( Table S1). Particularly,t he
red-emissive P1e /2a film exhibited aP LQY of 6.7 %w ith CIE
coordinates of (0.63, 0.36) (Figure S35). Thep hotostability
study showed that the P1e /2a film retained more than 70 %o f
its initial absorbance when irradiated by white light at ap ower
density of 100 mW cm@2 for 60 min, indicating its good
photostability (Figure S36). Thee fficient solid-state emission
of the polymers indicated their great potential as light-
emitting coating materials and fluorescent sensors.
High-refractive-index polymers are promising candidate
materials for optical engineering applications,s uch as optical
chips,p risms,o ptical waveguides,a nd holographic image
recording systems.[29] Polarizable aromatic rings and heter-
oatoms (particularly halogen elements) are well-known con-
tributors for enhancing the refractive index (n).[30] In view of
the unique chemical structure,w em easured the n values of
the synthesized polymers with polarized heteroaromatic
fused rings by using P1c /2a and P1e /2a for demonstration.
As summarized in Figure 2D,b oth polymers showed high
n values with small chromic dispersion. Interestingly,P 1e /2a
possessed high n values of 1.686–1.600 in the spectral region
of 575–1690 nm, which were higher than those of some
inorganic gems,s uch as emerald (n1079.5 = 1.566 and n1341.4 =

1.560), and much higher than those of the commercial optical
polymers,s uch as polycarbonate (n632.8 = 1.581), poly(methyl
methacrylate) (n632.8 = 1.489 and n1550 = 1.481), and polydi-
methylsiloxane (n632.8 = 1.428).[31]
Theg eneration of highly ordered macro- and micro-
fluorescent patterns by photolithography is of great signifi-
cance for the construction of optical display devices,o ptical
writing and reading, and anti-counterfeiting applications.[32]
Thanks to the excellent film-forming ability and efficient
solid-state emission of the present polymers,i ti sp ossible to
fabricate their uniform fluorescent films without defects on
silica wafers by as imple spin-coating technique.U pon
exposing the polymer thin films to UV light at room
temperature for 40 min under ac ustomizable photomask,
the fluorescence of the exposed regions was completely
quenched due to the photo-oxidation of the chromophores,[25]
whereas the masked regions remained intact and highly
emissive (Figure 2E ), which favored the generation of
af luorescent QR code pattern. In addition to macro-pattern,
other sophisticated patterns with varying sizes and contents
could also be readily generated by changing the scale and
shape of the photomask. As shown in Figure 2F,af luorescent
rose-shaped macro-pattern was easily created. When exam-
ining the enlarged image of as elected location, it was found
that each region in the macro-pattern was actually composed
of gridlike micro-pattern with sharp edges,i ndicating the high
resolution and structural complexity.T he facile,r apid, and
precise generation of highly emissive patterns demonstrated
the promise of the present polymers in photonic and
electronic applications.
Heteroaromatic cations such as pyridinium salts and
quinolizinium salts have been reported to be typical acceptor
groups for efficient generation of ROS.[19b,3 3] In this regard,
the novel heteroaromatic,c arbocationic moieties in the
present polyelectrolytes encouraged us to explore their
ROSg eneration ability.T wo commercial ROS indicators,
including 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) and 9,10-anthrace-
nediyl-bis(methylene)dimalonica cid (ABDA), were used to
evaluate ROSg eneration of the P1c /2a ,P 1d /2a ,P 1e /2a ,a nd
P1e /2c as demonstration. DCFH is an onfluorescent probe,
but can be converted to the highly fluorescent form (2’,7’-
dichlorofluorescein;D CF) when oxidized by various ROS.A s
shown in Figure 3A and Figure S37, in the absence of
polymers,D CFH remained nonfluorescent even upon
white-light irradiation (8 mW cm@2). In contrast, in the
presence of polymers and white-light irradiation, the emission
associated with DCF at 524 nm was significantly increased,
indicating that these polymers could be used to sensitize the
generation of ROS.
Singlet oxygen (1O2)i so ne of the important ROSs pecies
with significant applications in several fields,i ncluding
organic synthesis and photodynamic therapy.[34] It is thus
essential to measure the 1O2 generation ability of these
polymers.I nt he presence of 1O2,t he absorption of ABDA
became weakly due to its conversion to endoperoxide.T hus,
under white-light irradiation, we recorded the absorbance
spectra of ABDAi nt he presence of P1e /2a ,P 1c /2a ,P 1d /2a ,
and P1e /2c (Figure 3B and Figure S38). Forc omparison, the
performance of Rose Bengal, am ost widely used photo-
sensitizer for 1O2 generation, was also tested under the same
condition. In the presence of polyelectrolytes and white-light
irradiation, an oticeable decrease of ABDAa bsorption at
378 nm was observed. Specifically,t he 1O2 generation effi-
ciency of P1e /2a was much higher than Rose Bengal. P1c /2a
and P1d /2a were also able to generate 1O2 more effectively
than Rose Bengal, but P1e /2c showed inferior performance.
According to am ethod reported in previous studies,[35] the 1O2
quantum yields of P1c /2a ,P 1d /2a ,P 1e /2a ,a nd P1e /2c were
determined to be 0.943, 0.899, 0.975, and 0.375, respectively
(Figure S39). Thes trong 1O2 generation efficiency of P1c –e/
2a was probably ascribed to its conjugated D-A structure,
which significantly reduced the singlet-triplet energy gap and
promoted the intersystem crossing (ISC) process.O nt he
other hand, the compact hyperbranched structures of P1c –e/
2a rigidified the intramolecular motions of the polymer
backbones,w hich suppressed the nonradiative decay and
facilitated the ISC process.A lthough P1e /2c also possessed
as trong D-A pair in the polymer structure,i ts 1O2 generation
ability was quite low due to the active intramolecular motions
induced by the flexible oligo(ethylene glycol) chains,w hich
consumed the excited-state energy nonradiatively.
Thes trong 1O2 generation ability of the polymers
encouraged us to further explore their potential in photo-
dynamic killing of bacteria. P1e /2a ,t he strongest photo-
sensitizer for ROSg eneration, was chosen for subsequent
biological experiments.W ef irst characterized the particle size
and zeta potential of P1e /2a aggregates upon addition of its
solution to phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Theh ydro-
dynamic diameter of P1e /2a aggregates ranged from 70–
150 nm with az eta potential of 7.79 : 0.75 mV (Figure 4A ).
Furthermore,w ea lso performed transmission electron mi-
croscopy (TEM) characterization to confirm the particle size
(Figure 4A inset). Because of its positive charge,P 1e /2a
tended to accumulate on the negatively charged bacterial
membrane through electrostatic interactions.S uch property
enabled fluorescent labeling of methicillin-resistant Staph-
ylococcus aureus (MRSA) by P1e /2a within 60 min (Fig-
ure 4B ). Next, we evaluated the quantitative inactivation of

MRSA by P1e /2a in the presence or absence of white-light
irradiation (Figure S40 and Figure 4C ). In the dark, there was
am oderate concentration-dependent inhibition on the bac-
terial viability,w hich was attributed to the membrane-
damaging effect of the positively charged polymers.I n
contrast, the viability significantly decreased by two orders
of magnitude in the presence of white-light irradiation due to
the additional destructive effect by the produced ROSb y
P1e /2a .W hent he concentration of P1e /2a reached
30 mgm L@1,t he bacterial killing efficiency was determined
to be 99.2 %, which indicated the outstanding photodynamic
effect of P1e /2a .T ov isualize the antibacterial effect of P1e /
2a ,l ive/dead dual-color fluorescent staining was performed.
As shown in Figure 4D,a large proportion of MRSA
incubated with P1e /2a were stained with green fluorescence
in the absence of light irradiation, indicating the relatively
large survival rate and weak antibacterial effect. In contrast,
the ratio of red fluorescence was remarkably increased in the
presence of light irradiation, and no green fluorescence could
be found. These results were in accordance with the afore-
mentioned quantitative study.F urthermore,t he morphology
of MRSA upon different treatments was characterized by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 4E ). After
treated with P1e /2a in the absence of light irradiation, the
smooth membrane surface of the bacteria became rough and
was partially collapsed. When irradiated with white light, the
bacteria were damaged with serious membrane splitting and
deformation due to the photodynamic effect of P1e /2a .
Considering the high photokilling efficiency of P1e /2a
toward bacteria, it is possible to explore its new application in
photo-patterning of living organisms,w hich allows for the
creation of adaptive,c ustomizable,a nd dynamic bio-archi-
tectures to investigate their potential in cell migration, tissue
engineering,a nd biochips.[36] Because light is al ow-cost and
noninvasive manipulation tool with high spatiotemporal
resolution, we decided to fabricate living bacterial patterns
by means of the photodynamic effect of P1e /2a ,i nw hich
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing S. aureus was
employed to visualize the dynamic change of the resulting
biopatterns.A ss hown in Figure 5A ,t he dilute bacterial
solution mixed with P1e /2a was irradiated by white light
through ap re-printed gridlike adhesive mask for 20 min. The
ROSg enerated by the polymers efficiently killed the bacteria
in the unmasked region, while the bacterial viability in the
masked region remained unaffected. Further incubation of
the whole set-up in the dark favored the rapid growth and
proliferation of the GFP-expressing S. aureus in the masked
region, leading to the formation of an array of bacterial grids
that were replicated from the mask. We then monitored the
dynamic change of the produced biopatterns at 12, 18, 24, and
36-h post-incubation (Figure 5B ). Fort he group incubated
with P1e /2a and irradiated with white light, ac lear gridlike
pattern could be identified, which became denser in the

masked region (i.e.g rid) and coarser in the unmasked region
(i.e.s lit) over time.I nc ontrast, no evident gridlike patterns
were created for the control groups without the addition of
P1e /2a .S uch results were also confirmed by the correspond-
ing fluorescence images taken under a3 65-nm UV lamp
(Figure S41). To gain more insight into the details of bacterial
growth, we employed confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) to characterize the three-dimensional (3D) structure
of the living bacterial patterns (Figure 5C ). At 12-h post-
incubation, ar epresentative grid was sparse in shape,w hich
was characterized by at ypical size of 1796 : 7 mm X 1795 :
4 mmw ith ah eight of 138 : 5 mm. Upon extending the
incubation time,t he grid gradually expanded, and the
corresponding dimensional parameters changed to 2183 :
3 mm X 2199 : 6 mm X 407 : 3 mma t3 6-h post incubation.
Meanwhile,t he fluorescence in the slit started to emerge and
eventually merged with the grid, and the spacing distance
between adjacent grids was narrowed from 960 : 2 mma t1 2-h
post incubation to 551 : 8 mma t3 6-h post incubation (Fig-
ure S42). As photodynamic biopatterning provided as imple
and cost-effective way to fabricate 3D living biopatterns,t he
present results thus demonstrated the potential of these
hyperbranched polyelectrolytes in photo-manipulating the
biological behaviors of living organisms.
Conclusion
We developed an efficient multicomponent polymeri-
zation to in situ generate functional heteroaromatic hyper-
branched polyelectrolytes using readily accessible internal
diynes and low-cost, commercially available arylnitriles,
NaSbF6,a nd H2O/AcOH in ao ne-pot manner.C ompared
with conventional synthetic approaches,t he present strategy
involved neither unstable and expensive monomers nor
strictly controlled conditions.T he polymerization could

proceed efficiently with ab road spectrum of monomers,
affording functional polymers in excellent yields (up to 99 %)
and extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011 X
106). Notably,a ll the polymers showed low Y values and high
solubility in common organic solvents,r egardless of their
molecular weights and fused aromatic units.T he positively
charged heteroaromatic rings were highly electron-deficient,
which facilitated the formation of D-A structures and
concurrently endowed the polymers with tunable emission.
Thec ompact hyperbranched architecture of the polymers
restricted their intramolecular motions to suppress the non-
radiative decay to result in high fluorescence quantum yields
(up to 14.3 %) in the solid state,w hich enabled the polymers
to fabricate highly ordered fluorescence photopatterns at
different scales.U pon white-light irradiation, these polymers
could produce considerate ROS for the efficient inactivation
of bacteria. Furthermore,w e, for the first time,d emonstrated
the possibility of the hyperbranched polyelectrolytes for the
creation of customizable living bacterial patterns via PDT.
Thee fficient multicomponent polymerization introduced
here provided af acile strategy for the synthesis of hyper-
branched polyelectrolytes to enrich their family members.
Theu nique properties and functionalities of the resulting
polymers offered great opportunities for am ultitude of
follow-up studies,s uch as photoelectronic materials,d isease
