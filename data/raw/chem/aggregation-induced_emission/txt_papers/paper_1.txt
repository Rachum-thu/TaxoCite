ABSTRACT: Polyelectrolytes play an important role in both natural
biological systems and human society, and their synthesis, functional
exploration, and profound application are thus essential for biomimicry
and creating new materials. In this study, we developed an e ﬃ cient
synthetic methodology for in situ generation of azonia-containing
polyelectrolytes in a one-pot manner by using readily accessible nonionic
reactant in the presence of commercially available cheap ionic species.
The resulting polyelectrolytes are emissive in the solid state and can
readily form luminescent photopatterns with di ﬀerent colors. The
azonia-containing polyelectrolytes possess extraordinary potency of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, enabling them to
impressively kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a
drug resistant superbug, both in vitro and in vivo .
■ INTRODUCTION
Many important biological macromolecules are polyelectro-
lytes, such as DNA, proteins, polypeptides, and polysacchar-
ides.
1−3 Polyelectrolytes are ionizable polymers possessing the
combined behaviors of polymers and electrolytes, which can
drastically change the ﬂuid properties of aqueous solutions and
interact with oppositely charged macromolecules, small ions,
and even neutral particles. Polyelectrolytes have demonstrated
great potency in many aspects, for example, thickening agents
in food industry, wastewater treatment in environment science,
and diagnostic and therapeutic agents in medicine.
4,5 For
biomimicry and creating new materials, it is attractive to
synthesize and study polyelectrolytes. However, the progress is
unsatisfactory because of their synthetic di ﬃ culty.6 The main
methodology for the synthesis of polyelectrolytes is post-
modiﬁcation of nonionic polymers. 7−9 One archetype example
is sodium polystyrenesulfonate (NaPSS), which is synthesized
by adding sulfonate groups after polymerization.
10,11 Another
typical example is poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), which is generally
obtained by the hydrolysis of polyacrylate. 12,13 Theoretically,
the postmodiﬁcations are hard to be 100% completed, allowing
patches along the polymer chain, which are impossible to be
removed and puri ﬁed. Some coupling reactions (Heck
14 and
Sonogashira 15) are also employed for the synthesis of
polyelectrolytes, but they frequently require expensive and
limited types of ionic monomers.
Most commercially available polyelectrolytes (such as
NaPSS and PAA) are commodity polymers, which are cheap
and useful in daily life but show no advanced functional
properties. 16,17 Specialty polymers (such as conducting
polymers, liquid crystalline polymers, and biomedical poly-
mers) are attracting much interest because of their novel
functionalities. 18−23 There has been some progress in
developing specialty polyelect rolytes, with water-soluble
conjugated polymers being a typical example. Plenty of
water-soluble conjugated polymers have been designed and
synthesized for bioimaging, diagnosis, and therapy, 24−28 using
their ﬂuorescence and photodynamic properties. However,
traditional specialty polymers often su ﬀer from the aggrega-
tion-caused quenching e ﬀect in the condensed state, which
signiﬁcantly decreases their emission e ﬃ ciency or intersystem
crossing (ISC) e ﬃ ciency because of the high probability of the
excited state to undergo nonradiative relaxation. 29 As it is hard

to completely avoid aggregation in diverse practical applica-
tions, new specialty polyelectrolytes are in great demand to
address these problems.
30
In our previous work, some azonia aromatic compounds
have been found to show aggregation-induced emission (AIE)
characteristics with strong reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation ability.
31−34 The azonia rings are highly electron-
deﬁcient, and it is thus easy to form donor −acceptor (D −A)
structures with tunable emission color by combining with
diﬀerent electron donors.
35 Many reported antibiotics are also
azonia-containing molecules, but the processability of these
small molecules is quite limited.
36 Thus, we intend to combine
the excellent performance of azonia aromatic compounds with
processable polymers to create new functional materials with
expectable optical properties and processability. The resulting
azonia-containing polyelectrolytes are expected to show good
processing ability that can be easily fabricated into luminescent
ﬁlms for applications in surface modi ﬁcation, patterning, and
large area display systems. With high charge density in the
polymer chain, the azonia-containing polyelectrolytes may
show a ﬃ nity to negative charge species (such as bacteria
membrane and DNA), which enables them to wrap the surface
of bacteria and physically kill them.
4,37,38 By introducing D −A
structure into the polyelectrolytes, the nonradiative decay
channel is blocked due to the rigid structure,
29 which is
beneﬁcial for bioimaging and ROS generation. As a result, the
azonia-containing polyelectrolytes are potential powerful
weapons to kill superbugs by photodynamic therapy besides
physically killing.
39,40
Owing to the attractive properties of azonia aromatic
compounds, many novel approaches have been developed for
the synthesis of azonia small molecules,
41 including ring-
closing metathesis reactions, 42,43 annulation reactions based on
C−H activation, 44−46 and so on. However, it is challenging to
develop these small molecule reactions for polymer synthesis
due to the limited organic reactions with mild reaction
conditions, broad monomer scope, and high e ﬃ ciency. In
2017, Jun et al. reported an e ﬃ cient method for the synthesis
of benzoquinolizinium salts in a one-pot manner from simple
starting materials ( Scheme 1A).
47 Inspired by this work, we try
to develop such an e ﬃ cient small molecule reaction into a
useful tool for the synthesis of azonia-containing polyelec-
trolytes.
In this study, we developed a synthetic methodology by
readily accessible nonionic reactant in the presence of
commercially available cheap ionic species to in situ generate
azonia-containing polyelectrolytes in a one-pot manner. The
main-chain polyelectrolytes were generated in excellent yields
(up to 99%) with high molecular weights (up to 28700 Da).
The azonia-containing polyelectrolytes were luminescent in the
solid state with good processing ability, which enabled them to
be excellent candidate materials for ﬂuorescent photopattern
generation. With extraordinary strong ROS generation ability,
these polyelectrolytes could impressively solve the bacterial
resistance issue. Systematic antibacterial explorations were
conducted, including bacteria staining and killing methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a drug resistant
superbug in vitro and in vivo .
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Polymerization. Monomers used in this work are easily
available. Allylamines 1a and 1b, tetra ﬂuoroboric acid (HBF 4,
3a), sodium hexa ﬂuorophosphate (NaPF 6, 3b), sodium
triﬂuoromethanesulfonate (NaCF 3SO3, 3c), sodium tetraphe-
nylborate (NaBPh 4, 3d), sodium tetra ﬂuoroborate (NaBF 4),
and hexa ﬂuorophosphoric acid (HPF 6) were commercially
available and used without further puri ﬁcation. The internal
diynes 2a−h used in this work were readily synthesized
without column chromatography puri ﬁcation. All of the
polymerizations were catalyzed by [Cp *RhCl2]2 and Cu-
(OAc)2·H2O and conducted under an air atmosphere in a one-
pot manner.
To obtain soluble polyelectrolytes with high molecular
weights in high yields, we systematically investigated the
polymerization conditions using 1a, 2a, and 3a as monomers.
The solvent, monomer ratio, catalyst loading, concentration,
and reaction time were carefully investigated ( Table 1 ). The
eﬀect of solvent on the polymerization was ﬁrst investigated
(entries 1 −5, Table 1 ). Polar solvents such as MeOH, DCM,
MeOH/DMSO, and MeOH/DCM mixed solvents were
investigated, and the best polymerization result was obtained
in MeOH/DCM (v/v, 1/1), a ﬀording polymer with M
w of
19200 Da in 72% yield (entry 5, Table 1 ). It was found that
the monomer ratio (entries 5 and 6, Table 1 ) exerted little
eﬀect on the polymerization, while the catalyst loading (entries
5 and 7 −9, Table 1 ) played a crucial role in the polymer-
ization. Decreasing the amount of [Cp *RhCl2]2 from 10 to 5
mol % even increased the Mw and yield (entry 7, Table 1), but
further reducing the loading of [Cp *RhCl2]2 or Cu(OAc) 2·
H2O led to a sharp decrease in both the values of Mw and yield.
With the optimized catalyst loading, we further investigated the
eﬀect of monomer concentration and reaction time on the
polymerization. When the monomer concentration of 1a was
decreased from 0.2 to 0.15 M, both the M
w and yield decreased
sharply (entry 11, Table 1). When the monomer concentration
of 1a was improved from 0.2 to 0.25 M, the Mw and yield
decreased slightly, with partial gelation occurring (entry 10,
Table 1 ). A time of 24 h was adopted as the optimal reaction
time, as a further decrease of the reaction time led to
unsatisfactory values of M
w and yield (entries 12 and 13, Table
1).

With the optimized polymerization conditions in hand,
diﬀerent monomer combinations were applied to test the
robustness and wide applicability of this polymerization route
(Table 2). Monomers 2a−c were internal diynes with a ﬂexible
alkyl chain or oxyalkyl chain as a spacer, while 2d−f were rigid
conjugated diynes with di ﬀerent electron densities. Monomers
3a−d were abundant and cheap acid or salt. Diynes 2a−f all
reacted e ﬃ ciently with 1a and 3a,a ﬀording polyelectrolytes
with high yield and molecular weight (entries 1 −6, Table 2 ).
The diarylacetylene structure was crucial for this polymer-
ization, as only a trace amount of product was obtained when
tert-butyl-substituted diyne 2g (Scheme S1 ) was used as a
diyne monomer to react with 1a and 3a. The ﬂuorene-
substituted diyne 2h (Scheme S1 )a l s of a i l e dt ob e
polymerized e ﬀectively, probably due to the large steric
hindrance of the ﬂuorene moiety. Regarding the monomer
scope of allylamines, both unsubstituted allylamine 1a or
methyl-substituted allylamine 1b could react e ﬃ ciently with
diyne 2a or 2e in the presence of 3a (entries 1, 2, 7, and 8,
Table 2). However, 1b was less reactive compared to 1a, which
was probably due to the steric hindrance of the methyl group.
Finally, we further explored the in ﬂuence of ion source on the
polymerization process. On the basis of the mechanism of
small molecules,
47 we proposed a mechanism of the polymer-
ization route ( Scheme S3 ). In the proposed mechanism, the
ion source could react with the seven-membered rhodacycle
complex D to form benzoquinolizium salt, which was crucial to
the polymerization. We had demonstrated that HBF
4 3a,
NaPH6 3b, and NaCF 3SO3 3c could react e ﬃ ciently with 1a
and 2a to generate polyelectrolytes with moderate Mw and
yield (entries 1, 9, and 10, Table 2), while the NaBPh 4 3d was
much less reactive with 1a and 2a (entry 11, Table 2 ),
presumably resulting from the steric hindrance. HPF 6 failed to
polymerize with 1a and 2a, probably due to the too strong
acidity or decomposition upon heating of HPF 6. These results
indicated that we successfully developed an e ﬃ cient and
powerful polymerization tool for the construction of azonia-
containing polyelectrolytes. The only byproduct produced
from this polymerization was hydrogen ion, indicating its high
atom economy.
Most of the obtained polyelectrolytes showed good
solubility in commonly used organic solvents, such as DCM,
chloroform, DMSO, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
whereas P1b/2a/3a and P1a/2a/3c were partially insoluble in
these solvents. The thermal properties of the polyelectrolytes
were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the
results indicated that the 5% weight loss temperatures ( T
d)
were in the range 218 −323 °C( Figure S4 ), suggesting that
they were thermally stable. Additionally, P 1a/2d/3a and P1a/
2e/3a displayed 70% of their weight even upon heating to 800
°C.
Structural Characterization. The structures of the
resulting polymers were characterized by FT-IR and NMR
spectra. To gain insight into the structures of these azonia-
containing polyelectrolytes, model compound 2 was prepared
by cascade double N-annulation reaction of allylamine 1a,
diphenylacetylene 1, and HBF
4 under the same synthetic
conditions for the polyelectrolytes ( Scheme S2 ). Typical FT-
IR analysis and 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of polymer
P1a/2a/3a, model compound 2, and their corresponding
monomers 1a and 2a were performed accordingly for further
illustration. In the FT-IR spectra ( Figure S1 ), the N −H
stretching vibration of 1a and the C C stretching vibrations
of 2a occurred at 3012 and 2220 cm −1, respectively. These

peaks could not be observed in the spectra of P 1a/2a/3a and
2. Meanwhile, a new peak associated with B −F stretching
vibrations appeared at 1083 cm −1, indicating the successful
occurrence of the reaction. Similar results were obtained in the
FT-IR spectra of other polymers ( Figures S2 and S3 ).
In addition, NMR spectra could provide more detailed
information about the polymer structures. In the 1H NMR
spectra, the protons at positions “a”, “b”, and “c” of 1a resonate
at δ 5.95, 5.43, and 3.63 ppm, respectively, but disappeared in
the 1H NMR spectra of P 1a/2a/3a and 2. Most importantly,
new peaks emerged at δ 8.84 and 8.37 ppm in the spectra of
P1a/2a/3a and 2, corresponding to the aromatic protons from
the newly formed benzoquinolizinium rings ( Figure 1 A−D).
The 13C NMR spectra further veri ﬁed the polymer structure
(Figure 1 E−H). The characteristic peaks of C Ci n 2a were
not observed in the polymer spectrum. Instead, the aromatic
carbon on benzoquinolizinium rings resonated at δ 143−120
ppm in the spectra of P 1a/2a/3a and 2. For all of the 11
polyelectrolytes, the characteristic peaks at δ 8.90−8.10 ppm
all emerged in their 1H NMR spectra and their characteristic
CC peaks at δ 90.0−88.0 ppm all disappeared in their 13C
NMR spectra, con ﬁrming successful fabrication of their azonia-
containing polyelectrolytes accordingly ( Figures S22 −S48).
Photoluminescence (PL) Properties and Photopat-
tern. The absorption and emission spectra of dilute DCM
solutions (10 μM) of the resulting azonia-containing
polyelectrolytes were shown in Figures S6 and S7 . Due to
the strong electron-withdrawing azonia aromatic moiety, the
maximum emission wavelength of these polymers was facilely
tunable from 490 to 610 nm, which arised from the
polymerization from diyne monomers with di ﬀerent electron
densities.
By incorporating TPE and TPA moieties into the
polyelectrolyte skeletons, respectively, the resulting polymers
P1a/2d/3a and P 1a/2e/3a showed typical AIE features.
Taking P 1a/2d/3a as an example, its DCM solution emitted
weakly at 574 nm. With the addition of hexane, a nonpolar
poor solvent for the polymer, the emission intensity gradually
increased. The photographs of these dispersions taken in
DCM/hexane mixtures with di ﬀerent hexane fractions visually
showed the trends in ﬂuorescence ( Figure 2 A), and the
maximum emission wavelengths slightly blue-shifted to 558 nm
(Figure 2 B). The PL intensity of P 1a/2d/3a aggregates in
DCM/hexane mixture with 99% hexane fraction ( I
99) was
∼13-fold higher than that in pure DCM solution ( I0)( Figure
2C). A similar phenomenon was observed for P 1a/2e/3a
(Figure S9 ).
After that, the solid ﬂuorescence of these azonia-containing
polyelectrolytes was examined ( Figure 2 D); all of these
polymers were emissive in the solid state. P 1a−b/2a−c/3a−
b displayed yellow-green emission, P 1a/2d/3a and P1b/2e/3a
emitted orange ﬂuorescence, and P 1a/2e/3a exhibited red
emission. PL spectra of these polymers in the solid state were
further obtained ( Figure 2 E). Because of the excellent
solubility and ﬁlm-forming ability of P 1/2/3, their uniform
ﬁlms could be easily fabricated without defect on silica wafers
by a simple spin-coating technique.

Macroscopically processable polymers with high refractive
indices (RIs) are promising candidate materials for various
photonic applications, including optical chips, prisms, optical
waveguides, memories, and holographic image recording
systems.48 Since multifused heterocyclic rings were incorpo-
rated in the polymer main chain, the azonia-containing
polyelectrolytes are expected to show a high refractive index.
The thin ﬁlms of P 1/2/3 were prepared by spin-coating, and
their refractive indexes were measured accordingly. As
summarized in Figure S8 and Table S1 , their thin ﬁlms indeed
showed high n values of 1.817 −1.600 in the spectral region of
400−900 nm. Their n values at 632.8 nm ( n
632.8) were in the
range 1.686 −1.621, which were much higher than common
polymers such as polystyrene, polycarbonate, poly(methyl
methacrylate), and polyacrylate with n632.8 in the region of
1.49−1.58.49
The generation of ﬂuorescent patterns by the photo-
lithography technique is of great signi ﬁcance in terms of the
photonic and electronic applications. 50−52 As shown in Figure
2F−H, after irradiation by UV light in air for 20 min through a
copper photomask, the ﬂuorescence of the exposed regions
(lines) was completely quenched due to the photo-oxidation of
the chromophores, while the emissive squares were protected
by copper and remained intact. Thus, two-dimensional
ﬂu o r e s c e n tp a t t e r n sw i t hd iﬀerent emissive colors were
generated with high resolution and sharp edges. By changing
the shape and scale of the photomask, various patterns in
diﬀerent scales could be generated, such as QR code, which
could be used for information storage ( Figure 2 I). Herein,
these azonia-containing polyelectrolytes were expected to be
promising materials for pattern fabrication, which would have
profound implications in constructing electronic and photonic
devices and various hybrid devices as excellent luminescent
photoresist materials in a cost-e ﬃ cient photolithography
process. The photostability result showed that these poly-
electrolytes were stable under the exposure of normal room
light ( Figures S13 and S14 ) and were also able to undergo a
photo-oxidative bleaching process with a tunable refractive
index under the exposure of a strong UV light source ( Figure
S16, Table S3 ).
ROS Generation. The unique azonia moiety in these
polymers encouraged us to explore their ROS generation
ability and application in bacteria killing.
53−55 H2DCF-DA is a
commercial ROS indicator, which is non ﬂuorescent but emits
green ﬂuorescence when oxidized by ROS. 56 H2DCF-DA was
utilized to investigate the ROS generation ability of these

azonia-containing polyelectrolytes, and P 1a/2e/3a,P 1a/2d/
3a, and P 1a/2c/3a were chosen for demonstration. As shown
in Figure S10 , in the mixture of polyelectrolytes and H2DCF-
DA, the ﬂuorescence intensity of H2DCF-DA at 525 nm
increased gradually with the extension of irradiation time. A
steeper slope of curves indicated a much higher ROS
generation rate, suggesting that three polyelectrolytes exhibited
ad i ﬀerent ROS generation e ﬃ ciency in the order of P 1a/2e/
3a >P 1a/2d/3a >P 1a/2c/3a.
Among all of the ROS species, such as superoxide (O
2
−),
hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), hydroxyl radical ( OH), and
singlet oxygen ( 1O2), 1O2 is regarded as a primary cytotoxic
agent.57 Herein, 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)-dimalonic
acid (ABDA), a speci ﬁc probe to detect 1O2, was utilized to
prove the generation of 1O2 from azonia-containing poly-
electrolytes.58 In the presence of 1O2, ABDA is transformed
into endoperoxide, leading to a decrease of ABDA absorption
at 378 nm. The absorbance spectra of ABDA solution in the
presence of P 1a/2c/3a,P 1a/2d/3a, and P 1a/2e/3a were
recorded upon white light irradiation ( Figure 3 A−C). In the
presence of these polyelectrolytes, noticeable reduction of
ABDA absorption was observed, especially for P 1a/2e/3a,
which caused the fastest drop of ABDA absorption ( Figure
3D). For comparison, a commercial dye, Rose Bengal, which
was widely used to generate
1O2 with a singlet oxygen quantum
yield of 75%, was investigated under the same condition
(Figures S11 and S12 ). The decomposition rates of ABDA in
the presence of polyelectrolytes and Rose Bengal were
calculated quanti ﬁcationally ( Figure 3 D), and the results
indicated that P 1a/2e/3a was able to generate
1O2 much more
eﬀectively than Rose Bengal. Such strong 1O2 generation
ability of P 1a/2e/3a was probably due to the extended
conjugation length between donor and acceptor, which
minimized the ΔE
ST and enhanced the possibility of the ISC
process. Also, the strong D −A conjugated structure of P 1a/
2e/3a rigidiﬁed its polymer backbone, which could minimize
its nonradiative decay and thus promote the ISC process.
Notably, undetectable ROS generation of monomers 1a, 2e,
and 3a was also proved by the chemical trapping measure-
ments with ABDA as an indicator ( Figure S17 ). The
photostability study showed that P 1a/2e/3a indicated better
photostability than organic dyes RB and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-
sulfonatophenyl)-porphyrin (TPPS), two traditional photo-
sensitizers generally employed for PDT ( Figure S15 ).
Superbug Killing. The strong
1O2 generation ability of
these polyelectrolytes motivated us to further explore its
performance as a photosensitizer in bacteria inhibition. P 1a/
2e/3a with the most signi ﬁcant ROS generation was chosen
for further biological evaluation. The hydrodynamic diameter
of P 1a/2e/3a micelles was determined to be ∼106 nm by
dynamic laser scattering (DLS) analysis, and the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis con ﬁrmed the spherical
morphology and size ( Figure 4A). Then, in vitro antimicrobial
activities of P 1a/2e/3a were ﬁrst evaluated toward representa-
tive Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli,
respectively ( Figure S18 ). The polymer showed weak
inhibition to E. coli even under light irradiation but strong
inhibition to S. aureus under white light irradiation with a
minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 15 μg/mL. The
diﬀerent antimicrobial ability was probably due to the
membrane di ﬀerence between Gram-negative bacteria and
Gram-positive bacteria; it was di ﬃ cult for polymer micelles to
access the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria due to its extra
protective membrane components.

MRSA is one of the most notorious drug-resistant Gram-
positive bacteria in the hospital environment and community
settings, leading to a variety of clinical syndromes such as
endocarditis, pneumonia, and central nervous system in-
fections.
59−61 As the polyelectrolyte P 1a/2e/3a showed good
inhibition to Gram-positive S. aureus, the inhibition potency
against MRSA was evaluated to further explore its antimicro-
bial ability against drug-resistant bacteria. As shown in Figure
4B, the high charge density in the polymer main chain enabled
P1a/2e/3a to possess a high a ﬃ nity to negatively charged
bacteria membrane and thus could stain MRSA quickly, as
short as 5 min. Furthermore, persistent ﬂuorescence was found
for bacteria even upon incubation for 60 min, which was
favorable for extended light irradiation.
After that, the quantitative MRSA inhibition of P 1a/2e/3a
was performed in the presence or absence of light
irradiation (Figure 4C). In the dark state, P 1a/2e/3a exhibited
moderate inhibition against MRSA, as the positive charges on
the polyelectrolyte main chain enabled the micelles to adhere
and fuse with the bacteria membrane and thus physically
damaged bacteria membrane to some extent.
62 Upon white
light irradiation, P 1a/2e/3a could generate 1O2 eﬃ ciently
apart from the physical damage e ﬀect, leading to much
stronger inhibition against MRSA with an MIC value of ∼30
μg/mL. In addition, the raw monomers 1a, 2e, and 3a of P1a/
2e/3a all exhibited minimal bacteria inhibition even in the
presence of light irradiation, which further highlighted
advantageous P 1a/2e/3a with remarkable PDT potency
(Figure S19 ).
Furthermore, the morphology change of MRSA upon
diverse treatments was observed by TEM and SEM analysis
(Figure 4D and E). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, both
the control sample and the single light-treating sample
exhibited a smooth membrane surface and an intact membrane

structure, while the cell surface of MRSA became rough and
out of shape under the treatment of P 1a/2e/3a in the dark
state; many micelles were found to be around the bacteria,
demonstrating e ﬃ cient binding, adhesion, and further fusion
with the MRSA membrane. Finally, as the yellow arrows
indicated, much more signi ﬁcant membrane shrinking and
deformation were observed upon micelle binding and extra
light irradiation.
To investigate the biocompatibility of the polyelectrolytes,
MTT assays were performed for P 1a/2e/3a upon incubation
with primary skin ﬁbroblast cells for 24 h. P 1a/2e/3a showed
undetectable toxicity toward the cells even up to 175 μg/mL
under light irradiation ( Figure S20 ), exhibiting good
biocompatibility and antibac terial selectivity, which was
favorable for in vivo applications.
An in vivo bacteria inhibition experiment was conducted on
a MRSA-infected mouse burn model.
63 Diﬀerent treatments
were applied to the MRSA-infected burn sites, and the
recovery process was evaluated in 14 days ( Figure 5 A). An
eﬀectively accelerated wound healing process was observed
when treated with vancomycin or P 1a/2e/3a with light
irradiation, as compared to the control group ( Figure 5 B and
C). After the whole treating process in 14 days, the mice were
sacriﬁced and their wound tissues were harvested for further
evaluation. Although vancomycin could also enhance the
wound healing process, the quantitative experiments showed
that the inhibition e ﬀect of P 1a/2e/3a under white light
irradiation was much better than vancomycin, the golden
standard for Gram-positive bacteria treatment ( Figure 5 D,
Figure S21 ). Histologic analysis was conducted to further
evaluate the treatment e ﬀect ( Figure 5 E). Normal mouse skin
was highly heterogeneous tissue, containing epidermis, dermis
with hair follicle, and subcutaneous layer. At the 14th day, the
control group only showed a partially re-epithelialized and
thickened epidermis, while tissue of the P 1a/2e/3a under the
light-irradiation-treated group showed an obvious re-epithe-
lialized epidermis, exhibiti ng intact skin microstructure
comparable with normal tissue. Thus, the in vivo MRSA-
infected mouse burn model demonstrated that the photo-
dynamic e ﬀect of P 1a/2e/3a could inhibit MRSA infection in
the burn injury mouse model and e ﬀectively accelerate the
healing process.

■ CONCLUSION
In summary, we have developed an e ﬃ cient one-pot
polymerization route to in situ generate functional azonia-
containing polyelectrolytes using readily accessible nonionic
reactants and commercially available cheap ionic species.
Compared with traditional synthetic strategies of polyelec-
trolytes, this new strategy did not require a postmodi ﬁcation
step or expensive ionic monomers. The polymerization
proceeded e ﬃ ciently in air with high tolerance to the
monomer feed ratio, generating polyelectrolytes in excellent
yields (up to 99%) with high molecular weights (up to 28700)
in high atom economy. With electron-de ﬁcient azonia fused
rings in the polymer main chain, the emission color of the
resulting polyelectrolytes could be easily tuned by changing the
electron donor. With high luminescence in the solid state,
good processing ability, and high refractive indices, these
polymers were excellent materials for ﬂuorescent photo-
patterns and promising for optical applications. Notably, the
azonia-containing polyelectrolytes had a strong ROS gener-
ation ability and could impressively kill the drug resistant
superbug. P 1a/2e/3a was demonstrated to e ﬀectively kill
MRSA both in vitro and in the MRSA-infected mouse burn
model. The e ﬃ cient one-pot synthetic methodology to azonia-
containing polyelectrolytes provided a new strategy for the
synthesis of polyelectrolytes, greatly enriching the family of
polyelectrolytes. Current charge-generating polymerization
provided these prominent functional positively charged
polyelectrolytes, which were promising candidates for various
biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, surface
modiﬁcation, and self-healing materials.
