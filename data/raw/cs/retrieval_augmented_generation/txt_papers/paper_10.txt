Abstract
Despite the central role of retrieval in retrieval-augmented genera-
tion (RAG) systems, much of the existing research on RAG over-
looks the well-established field of fair ranking and fails to account
for the interests of all stakeholders involved. In this paper, we con-
duct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate
fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and at-
tribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources
cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring
item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items re-
trieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts
both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources
in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting
with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that
incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even en-
hances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the
common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Ad-
ditionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more
balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the gen-
erator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore
the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation,
laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems
and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.

Figure 1: Fairness concerns in RAG. A simplified example
of how RAG models can ignore equally relevant items ( 𝑑3
and 𝑑4) and always consume the fixed top-scoring items ( 𝑑1
and 𝑑2) with the same order of ranking over the multiple
user requests. This is due to the deterministic nature of the
retrieval process and a short context-length of a language
model that necessitates the top- 𝑘 truncation of a ranked list.
despite its significance, fair ranking has yet to be thoroughly exam-
ined in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [
1, 33],
a rapidly advancing trend in natural language processing (NLP)
systems [
32]. To understand why this is important, consider the
RAG system in Figure 1, where a user asks a question about running
shoes. A classic retrieval system might return several documents
containing information from various running shoe companies. If
the RAG system only selects the top two documents, then informa-
tion from the remaining two relevant companies will not be relayed
to the predictive model and will likely be omitted from its answer.
The fair ranking literature refers to this situation as unfair because
some relevant companies (i.e., in documents at position 3 and 4)
receive less or no exposure compared to equally relevant company
in the top position [13].
Understanding the effect of fair ranking in RAG is fundamental
to ensuring responsible and equitable NLP systems. Since retrieval
results in RAG often underlie response attribution [17], unfair expo-
sure of content to the RAG system can result in incomplete evidence
in responses (thus compromising recall of potentially relevant in-
formation for users) or downstream representational harms (thus
creating or reinforcing biases across the set of relevant entities).
In situations where content providers are compensated for con-
tributions to inference, there can be financial implications for the
unfairness [4, 22, 36]. Indeed, the fair ranking literature indicates
that these are precisely the harms that emerge when people are
searchers [13], much less RAG systems, where the searchers are
machines. RAG complicates these challenges since it often trun-
cates rankings to much shorter lengths to fit the generator’s limited
context size [2, 23, 32], making equal exposure of relevant items
even harder.
33
ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy To Eun Kim and Fernando Diaz
Moreover, the fact that machines are now the searchers necessi-
tates a different notion of item-worthiness (how deserving an item
is to be included in a ranked list). Traditionally, ranking quality has
been assessed based on relevance labels, which are created accord-
ing to how relevant an item is to the user’s query [53]. However,
with RAG systems, where the consumer is a language model, there
is a growing shift towards evaluating ranking quality based on
utility labels, which are determined by the usefulness of an item in
aiding the model’s task performance, rather than its relevance to
the query [51, 62].
This shift from relevance to utility in the concept of item-worthiness
can significantly alter our understanding of the relationship be-
tween fairness and ranking quality [3]—particularly the tradeoffs
that are well-known in the fair ranking literature [5, 11, 56]. Since
previous fair ranking studies were conducted based on relevance
judgments, they may need to be reexamined in light of utility-based
judgments within the context of RAG.
However, purely focusing on how often certain items appear
in the top-𝑘 positions can neglect the fact that not all retrieved
items are necessarily attributed in the final generated response. If
an item is retrieved but never actually influences the RAG model’s
output, one cannot fully gauge whether it truly received exposure
from the standpoint of the final generation. This reveals a sub-
tle yet important gap: fair retrieval may not directly translate to
fair consumption, especially when some retrieved items might be
overshadowed in the generation step. Measuring how exposure
is ultimately distributed across the attributed sources in the final
response offers a more complete picture of exposure-based fairness
in the context of RAG systems.
Our research aims to bridge the gap between traditional fair
ranking studies and the emerging changes posed by RAG systems,
ultimately enhancing our understanding of the interplay between
fairness, ranking quality, and the effectiveness of RAG systems. We
do this by evaluating RAG systems with a fairness-aware retriever
across seven different tasks, experimenting with varying levels
of retrieval fairness to observe changes in ranking quality and
generation quality (utility)1, as well as the fairness of attributed
sources.
Our empirical results show that, in the context of machine users,
there also exists an overall trend of fairness-quality tradeoff with
respect to both retrieval and generation quality. However, the mag-
nitude of this tradeoff is not particularly severe. In fact, we find
that RAG models equipped with a fair ranker can often preserve
a significant level of retrieval and generation quality, and in some
cases, even surpass the quality achieved by the traditional RAG
setup with a deterministic ranker that lacks fairness considerations.
Moreover, while the fraction of retrieved sources that actually ap-
pear in the final response may vary, equitable retrieval frequently
leads to more equitable usage of those sources by the generator.
This surprising finding offers significant insight into the po-
tential of RAG-based applications, suggesting that fair treatment
of individual content providers can be achieved without sacrific-
ing much of the high-quality service delivered to end-users. This
challenges the conventional assumption of an inevitable tradeoff

refer to the downstream effectiveness of RAG models, measured by arbitrary string
utility metrics.
between fairness and quality, opening new avenues for developing
more equitable and effective RAG systems.
2 Background & Related Work
2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation
RAG, a specific type of retrieval-enhanced machine learning (REML)
[32, 60], has been widely adopted in various domains, including
language modeling [31], question-answering [27], and personal-
ization [40, 49, 50]. Studies on the evaluation of RAG models have
primarily focused on their effectiveness, including end-to-end per-
formance [20, 27, 33] and the assessment of individual components
[14, 47, 48, 51], such as retrieval relevance and model faithfulness.
Furthermore, recent efforts have explored attribution mechanisms
for ensuring the trustworthiness of RAG responses [16, 17], exam-
ining how thoroughly models reference the source text and thus
promoting a more faithful generation process.
However, little research has focused on evaluating fairness in
retrieval-enhanced generation models, with the exception of recent
work [54], which improved demographic diversity in human image
generation by conditioning a generative model with externally
retrieved images that help debias the generation process.
2.2 Fairness in Ranking
Fair ranking has been approached through various definitions based
on normative concerns, primarily with distinctions made according
to the stakeholders we prioritize. These include consumer-side fair-
ness [
12, 38], which focuses on how fairly a system delivers satisfac-
tion to users; provider-side fairness [28, 52], which addresses how
fairly item providers receive monetary or reputational rewards; and
item-side fairness [29], which examines how fairly items are treated
in terms of representation or exposure. The motivation of item-
side fairness is closely linked to provider-side fairness, as unfair
treatment of items can lead to unfair compensation for providers.
These fairness concerns can be further categorized by the scope of
stakeholders, encompassing individual fairness—ensuring similar
treatment for similar individuals—and group fairness—ensuring
equitable outcomes across different groups [8, 13]. Previous studies
have focused on developing metrics to measure fairness [44] and
optimizing fair retrievers within a single [ 52, 58, 61] or multiple
rankings [5, 11, 55, 56]. In the context of provider- and item-side
fairness, ensuring equal exposure of similar items across multiple
rankings has gained significant attention [13]. To achieve this, re-
searchers have used stochastic rankers that return a distribution
of rankings, in contrast to deterministic rankers commonly found
in areas like RAG, which produce a fixed ranking. This approach
ensures that, in expectation, similar items receive equal exposure
across multiple user requests, with the distributions typically based
on the merit of the rankings, such as an item’s relevance [11, 56].
In this research, we employ a stochastic ranker in RAG to en-
hance individual item-side fairness, aiming to ensure equal expected
exposure for items that offer similar merits.
3 Experimental Methodology
In traditional RAG systems, a user input is used to query a retrieval
system for recommended items from some corpus, which are then
used for generation. Given user input 𝑥, a query 𝑞 generated by the
34

query generation function 𝜙𝑞 (𝑥), and a corpus of documents C, a
deterministic retriever R (𝑞, C) returns a fixed ranked list 𝐿 every
time 𝑞 is seen. Retrieval is followed by a top 𝑘 truncation which is
passed to a prompt generation function 𝜙𝑝 (𝑥, 𝐿1:𝑘 ) that returns a
final prompt ¯𝑥, which is subsequently passed to the language model
G (¯𝑥). Because deterministic retrievers allocate exposure to the
same item over repeated samples, RAG systems with deterministic
retrievers present a challenge to ensuring equal exposure of relevant
items to the generator.
To address the issue of unfairness in the rankings passed to the
generator, we can convert a deterministic retriever into a stochas-
tic retriever, which can, in expectation, provide fair rankings [11].
By sampling a ranking based on its quality to users—in this case
generators—the expected exposure of different relevant items be-
comes similar and, therefore, fairer. Because decisions are stochastic,
the fairness and quality of stochastic retrieval is evaluated based
on a sample of rankings. Likewise, since each sampled ranking is
processed by a generator, we measure the expected generator effec-
tiveness over these sampled rankings. We also consider how fairly
exposure is allocated among the items that end up being attrib-
uted by the final output, acknowledging that some retrieved items
may not be credited in the generated text. The complete evaluation
pipeline of a RAG system with a stochastic retriever is illustrated
in Figure 2.
The following sections describe how we construct a test collec-
tion with utility labels (§3.1), how we stochastically sample multiple
rankings (§3.2), how we evaluate the fairness and ranking quality
of the sampled rankings (§3.3.1), and how we assess a RAG system’s
performance over sampled rankings (§3.3.2). We then explain how
we measure the expected number of attributed items (§3.3.3) and
evaluate the fairness of these attributed sources (§3.3.4).
3.1 Construction of a Test Collection with
Utility Labels
Setting an appropriate proxy for measuring item-worthiness is
crucial in the evaluation of fairness [3]. Drawing on the insight that
utility-based judgments are more suitable than relevance judgments
in the context of RAG [51, 62], we annotate item-level utility labels
for all items in the corpus.
We define an item’s worthiness by the marginal gain in util-
ity (utility-gain) it provides to a language model (specifically, the
generator in a RAG system) when used to solve a specific task as
part of the augmentation process. To assess this utility-gain, each
item in the corpus is individually supplied to the generator along
with an input question. The utility-gain is then calculated as the
difference between the utility of the augmented generator and that
of a baseline language model without any information about the
item. Formally, let 𝑢𝑖 denote the baseline string utility score from
the vanilla language model prompted only with the input question,
and let 𝑢 𝑗 represent the utility score from the language model with
a prompt augmented by the 𝑗’th item𝑑 𝑗 in the corpus. The item 𝑑 𝑗
is considered useful if the utility-gain 𝛿 𝑗 = 𝑢 𝑗 − 𝑢𝑖 is positive, and
not useful otherwise.
Therefore, the item-level utility labels are designed to be both
task- and generator-dependent, as the utility of each item varies
depending on the task and the language model used. This labeling

in retrieval-augmented generation. To evaluate system per-
formance across multiple identical user requests, we sample
𝑁 rankings from a stochastic retriever. Then, we measure
the fairness and quality of these rankings (Expected Expo-
sure §3.3.1), and then assess the system’s overall performance

pected Attribution Rate §3.3.3), and the fairness of attributed

process also aligns with the principles of task-based information
retrieval, where, in the context ofhuman searchers, document utility
may vary on how the user expects to use the document [30].
3.2 Fairness-Aware Stochastic Retriever
Stochastic retrievers have been used for various purposes, such as
optimization of retrieval models [7, 18, 41, 59], as well as ensuring
equitable exposure of items [11, 41, 42]. Many of these studies use
Plackett-Luce sampling [43] to achieve the stochasticity of retrieval.
We follow the line of research and formally define how we derive
a fairness-aware stochastic retriever through Plackett-Luce sam-
pling. To enhance sampling efficiency, we adopt the methodology
of Oosterhuis [41], and for controllable randomization, we utilize
the approach proposed by Diaz et al. [11].
Given 𝑛 items in a corpus C, a vector of retrieval scores s ∈ R𝑛
can be obtained from R (𝑞, C), which can be used to generate a
ranked list 𝐿. We then min-max normalize retrieval scores to be in
[0, 1] in order to construct a multinomial distribution over items
[5]. The probability of an item 𝑑 being selected as the 𝑖’th item in a
new ranking 𝜋 through Plackett-Luce sampling is given by
𝑝 (𝑑 |𝐿1:𝑖 −1) = exp(¯s𝑑 )1[𝑑 ∉ 𝐿1:𝑖 −1]Í
𝑑 ′ ∈C\𝐿1:𝑖 −1 exp(¯s𝑑 ′ ) (1)
where 𝐿1:𝑖 −1 is the partial ranking up to position 𝑖 − 1, ¯s represents
the normalized retrieval score vector, and¯s𝑑 is the normalized score
of item 𝑑. Using this probability, we iteratively sample an item, set
its probability to 0, renormalize the distribution, and repeat the
process. The probability of generating a complete ranking is then
given by the product of the placement probabilities for each item,
i.e., 𝑝 (𝜋 |𝑞) = Î𝑛
𝑖=1 𝑝 (𝜋𝑖 |𝜋1:𝑖 −1).
This repeated sampling and renormalization process can be effi-
ciently managed using the Gumbel-Softmax trick [19, 37], which
enables the sampling of rankings to be performed at the speed
35
ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy To Eun Kim and Fernando Diaz
of sorting [ 41]. To do so, for each sampling iteration, we draw
𝑈𝑖 ∼ Uniform(0, 1), followed by generating a Gumbel noise 𝐺𝑖 =
− log(− log(𝑈𝑖 )). The probability of each sampled ranking is then
obtained by sorting the items based on their perturbed scores
˜s𝑑𝑖 = ¯s𝑑𝑖 + 𝐺𝑖.
3.2.1 Controlling the Level of Fairness. Adjusting the level of
randomization directly controls the degree of item-fairness, aligning
with our goal to observe how varying levels of fairness in rankings
affect the ranking and generation quality of a RAG model. To obtain
the controllability, we follow the work of Diaz et al. [11] and use a
fairness control parameter 𝛼. We apply the scalar𝛼 to each value in
the normalized score vector ¯s by raising each value to the power of
𝛼.2 This process is done before the scores are passed to the sampling
policy. Therefore, the modified sampling distribution is thus defined
as:
𝑝 (𝑑 |𝐿1:𝑖 −1) =
exp(¯s𝛼
𝑑 )1[𝑑 ∉ 𝐿1:𝑖 −1]
Í
𝑑 ′ ∈C\𝐿1:𝑖 −1 exp(¯s𝛼
𝑑 ′ ) (2)
This implies that the sharpness of the sampling distribution is con-
trolled by the 𝛼. A higher 𝛼 amplifies the probability of items with
higher retrieval scores being sampled. Therefore, if multiple rank-
ings are sampled by the stochastic retriever with high 𝛼, it results
in high disparity (i.e., item-side unfairness) of sampled rankings. At
extreme, with considerably high𝛼, the procedure results in the iden-
tical rankings which is the behavior of a deterministic ranker (i.e.,
maximum item-unfairness). On the other hand, a lower 𝛼 reduces
the disparity of sampled rankings, making the exposure distribution
fairer. At extreme, when 𝛼 = 0, the sampling procedure becomes
uniformly random and achieves the lowest disparity (i.e., maximum
item-fairness) in the sampled rankings.
3.3 Evaluation
As mentioned in Section 3, because we are dealing with stochastic
retrievers, we need to measure the expected behavior of the system.
Let S (s, 𝑁 , 𝑘) be the stochastic sampler that samples a set of 𝑁
rankings 𝜎 = {𝜋 }, given the deterministic retrieval scores s, where
each ranking 𝜋 is truncated to the size of 𝑘. From each ranking,
we can get an output ˆ𝑦𝜋 = G (𝜙𝑝 (𝑥, 𝜋 )). With an arbitrary fairness
metric 𝜇𝑓 (𝜎) and a ranking quality metric 𝜇𝑟 (𝜎) that takes a set of
rankings as an input, we can measure the degree of fairness and
ranking quality of the sampled rankings. Similarly, an arbitrary
string utility metric
𝜇𝑢 (𝑦, ˆ𝑦𝜋 ), such as ROUGE, can be used to
assess an expected effectiveness of a RAG system by calculating
the average of the 𝑁 metric scores.
In this paper, based on the empirical investigation done by Raj
and Ekstrand [44], we use expected exposure disparity (EE-D) and
expected exposure relevance (EE-R) [11] as 𝜇𝑓 and 𝜇𝑟 , respectively
(§3.3.1). For 𝜇𝑢, we select the metric depending on the task, and we
get the expectation of the utility of a RAG model which we call an
expected utility (EU) (§3.3.2). Beyond these metrics, we also measure
the expected rate of attributed items (EAR) in §3.3.3, capturing how
many retrieved items are ultimately used by the generator, and
introduce the expected attributed exposure (EAE) in §3.3.4, which
evaluates fairness specifically among the items that are actually

effectively serves the same purpose as adjusting a real-numbered 𝛼. We chose this
range to allow for an integer-valued 𝛼.
attributed in the final output that can ultimately be displayed to
human users.
3.3.1 Expected Exposure in the Context of Machine Users.
Expected Exposure (EE) [ 11] works by estimating the exposure
of items across rankings (e.g., 𝜎) created by a subject model, and
comparing them with an optimal set of rankings that always satisfy
the item-fairness. To represent the attention over 𝑛 items in the
corpus given by the consumer (generator in RAG), an 𝑛 × 1 system
exposure vector 𝜖 is created. This is then compared with an 𝑛 × 1
target exposure vector 𝜖∗, where it represents the exposure of items
allocated by an oracle retriever that always rank useful items above
non-useful ones [11].
With the system and target exposure vector 𝜖 ∈ R𝑛 and 𝜖∗ ∈
R𝑛, we can get the difference between the two by the squared 𝑙2
distance: 𝜖 − 𝜖∗
2
2 = ∥𝜖 ∥2
2 − 2⟨𝜖, 𝜖∗⟩ +
𝜖∗
2
2 (3)
This difference yields two metrics useful for fairness and ranking
quality evaluation. ∥𝜖 ∥2
2 can be a measure for disparity of rankings
(EE-D), and ⟨𝜖, 𝜖∗⟩ can be a measure of ranking quality (EE-R)
by calculating the degree of alignment of system exposure to the
target exposure (i.e., how much of the exposure is on useful items).
Therefore, the higher the value of EE-D, the more unfair the set of
rankings are, and the higher the value of EE-R, the closer the set of
system rankings are to the optimal set of rankings with respect to
the ranking quality.
The exposure of an item is calculated by modeling users’ (e.g.,
generators in RAG) attention to each item in a ranking. For ex-
ample, one can assume that the user is affected by position bias
and gives attention following an exponential decay [39]. However,
these browsing models were developed for human-users not for
machine-users, so we need a different user behavior model for gen-
erators in RAG. For the simplicity of the metric, and given recent
efforts to reduce position bias and promote more even attention in
machine-user settings [21, 25], we assume that the machine user
consumes all items passed to the context with equal attention but
pays zero attention to items placed after the 𝑘’th position due to
top-𝑘 truncation. This makes the user browsing model a step func-
tion parameterized by 𝑘. In this work, a relevance-independent
machine-user model (MU) is set to the step function that reflects
the behavior of top-k truncation of RAG:
MU(𝑖) =
(
1 if 𝑖 ≤ 𝑘
0 otherwise = 1[𝑖 ≤ 𝑘] (4)
Given this machine user browsing model and a mapping from item
index to its rank denoted as ¯𝜋𝑑, a system exposure for each item 𝑑
is calculated as
𝜖𝑑 =
∑︁
𝜋 ∈𝑆𝑛
𝑝 (𝜋 |𝑞)MU( ¯𝜋𝑑 ) (5)

3.3.2 Expected Utility. Given the set of 𝑁 sampled rankings 𝜎,
we individually augment the generator with each ranking 𝜋 ∈ 𝜎,
resulting in 𝑁 outputs from the generator. The utility of these
outputs is then measured using an arbitrary string utility metric
𝜇𝑢. To determine the anticipated utility of a RAG model with fair
rankings—represented by the tuple of a stochastic ranking sampler
S and a generator G—we calculate the expected utility (EU) of the
RAG system given an instance 𝑥.

3.3.3 Expected Attribution Rate. We use a natural language
inference (NLI) model for attribution, reflecting its effectiveness in
measuring faithfulness. Honovich et al. [24] find that NLI outper-
forms other metrics in a meta-evaluation, leading works such as
automated citation evaluation using NLI [17], which strongly cor-
relates with human judgments. Building on the human evaluation
framework by Rashkin et al. [45], Gao et al. [16] introduced a new
NLI-based metric to approximate human judgments, followed by
Bohnet et al. [6]. These studies collectively show that NLI-based
methods capture attribution quality in a manner closely aligned
with human assessments, making them a reliable choice for our
evaluation.
Given a ranking 𝜋 ∈ 𝜎 of 𝑘 items and a predicted output ˆ𝑦𝜋 , we
therefore measure item attribution rate (AR) using
𝜇AR
 𝜋, ˆ𝑦𝜋
 = 1
𝑘
∑︁
𝑑 ∈𝜋
NLI(𝑑, ˆ𝑦𝜋 ) (8)
where NLI(𝑑, ˆ𝑦𝜋 ) =1 if item𝑑 entails the output ˆ𝑦𝜋 , and 0 otherwise,
by a natural language inference model. 3
Analogous to expected utility, we define expected attribution
rate (EAR) of a RAG system as
EAR(⟨S, G⟩| 𝑥) = E𝜋 ∼S [𝜇AR (𝜋, ˆ𝑦𝜋 )] (9)
=
∑︁
𝜋 ∈𝑆𝑛
𝑝 (𝜋 |𝑞)𝜇AR (𝜋, ˆ𝑦𝜋 ) ≈ 1
𝑁
∑︁
𝜋 ∈𝜎
𝜇AR (𝜋, ˆ𝑦𝜋 ).
3.3.4 Expected Attributed Exposure. While EE measures re-
trieval fairness and relevance, it does not capture whether the
retrieved items actually appear in the final generated output or how
fairly exposure is allocated among those items once they surface
after generation. To address this gap, we define the attributed expo-
sure vector 𝜖𝑎 ∈ R𝑛, where an attributed exposure for each item 𝑑
is calculated as
𝜖𝑎
𝑑 =
∑︁
𝜋 ∈𝑆𝑛
𝑝 (𝜋 |𝑞)NLI(𝑑, ˆ𝑦𝜋 ). (10)
3This metric is similar to the context utilization metric from Ru et al. [47], which also
measures how effectively the generator leverages retrieved context. However, Ru et al.
[47] decompose the generated response into multiple claims and focus only on the
proportion of relevant items, whereas our approach applies a single NLI check for
each retrieved item.
Similar to EE, a disparity measure expected attributed exposure dis-
parity (EAE-D) can be derived by measuring the squared𝑙2 distance
of an attributed exposure vector, thus
EAE-D(⟨S, G⟩| 𝑥) =
𝜖𝑎
2
2. (11)
Hence, EAE-D measures how fairly exposure is allocated across the
items that are explicitly used, addressing the shortcoming of EE by
directly linking exposure to items that influence the final output of
a RAG system.
3.3.5 Normalization of Metrics. Since EAR is an average over
the percentage of entailed items for each sampled ranking, its values
lie on a consistent scale with [0, 1] range. However, the bounds of
EE-D, EE-R, and EAE-D depend on the number of useful items in
the corpus. Consequently, we apply normalization on a per-query
basis by min-max scaling each metric according to its theoretical
lower and upper bounds. We denote the normalized EE-D, EE-R,
and EAE-D as EE-D, EE-R, and EAE-D respectively.
However, theoretically determining the bounds of the expected
utility (EU) of a RAG model is challenging. To address this, we
normalized the EU by the model’s empirical upper bound, the max-
imum observed utility across all runs of the experiment with the
same generators. To approach the true upper bound, these runs
include RAG models with an oracle retriever that consistently ranks
useful items (i.e., those with positive utility labels) above non-useful
ones, stochastically returning one of the 𝑚!(𝑛 − 𝑚)! different rank-
ings, where 𝑚 represents the number of useful items in the corpus.
We denote the normalized EU as EU, which can be interpreted as
the distance to the optimal utility.
4 Experiments
We choose the LaMP benchmark [50] for our dataset. It assesses the
personalization capability of language models through retrieval-
augmentation of users’ interaction history in a platform. LaMP
includes various prediction tasks, such as classification, regression,
and generation, and is well-suited for tasks where multiple items
can be relevant/useful, unlike QA tasks with typically one or two
provenance items. The retrieval items in LaMP have clear providers
and consumers, aligning with our goal to ensure fairness for indi-
vidual item providers. For example, in LaMP-1, retrieval items are
academic papers, where exposure can increase citation counts for
authors. In LaMP-4, retrieval items are news articles, where expo-
sure can lead to monetary compensation for journalists.4 Due to the
absence of a test set, we constructed a test collection as described in
§3.1, using the first thousand entries of a user-based development
set. Then, we discarded entries that have only one useful item in
the corpus, as it is unnecessary to concern item-fairness in that
case. We release the test collection along with dataset statistics.
We use BM25 (lexical retriever) [46], SPLADE (learned sparse
retriever) [15], and Contriever (bi-encoder dense retriever) [ 26]
as deterministic retrievers providing retrieval scores to base the
sampling on. These models represent commonly used retrievers in
the RAG literature [32]. We use a sampling size of 𝑁 = 100 and a
truncation size of 𝑘 = 5.
4Throughout this paper, we use LaMP-1 to represent classification and LaMP-4 to rep-
resent text generation in visualizations. All LaMP tasks were used in our experiments,
and similar trends were observed.

Figure 3: Effect of a fairness control parameter ( 𝛼) on the
disparity of rankings ( EE-D) in LaMP task 1 and 4. The RAG
model is configured with the Contriever and Flan-UL2. Each
data point represents the normalized EE-D of each run of the
experiment (i.e., one query → 𝑁 sampled rankings → EE-D
of the 𝑁 rankings).
For generation models, we use Flan-T5-Small, Flan-T5-Base, Flan-
T5-XXL [9], and Flan-UL2 [57]. For decoding strategy, beam size
is set to 4, and no sampling strategy is used. This is to ensure
that stochasticity is only introduced to the retriever for controlled
experiments. With the three base retrievers and four generators,
we configure twelve different RAG models and evaluate them on
the seven LaMP tasks. Utility measurement of the generated strings
follows the metrics used in the LaMP paper. For NLI computations,
a RoBERTa large model [35] fine-tuned on the natural language
inference task is used.5
We repeat the experiments with four different fairness control
parameters 𝛼 = 1, 2, 4, 8, which allows us to assess the utility of the
RAG models with different levels of item-fairness. From Figure 3,
we observe how effectively 𝛼, described in the Equation 2, controls
the disparity of rankings. For example, when𝛼 is set to 4, we usually
obtain a set of sampled rankings with EE-D mostly in the range
of [0.5, 0.8], and when 𝛼 is set to 8, we often get a set of sampled
rankings with EE-D = 1.
We conducted paired (per-query) 𝑡-tests for EE-D across the
different 𝛼 values and found statistically significant differences
(𝑝 < 0.01) in all 84 experimental conditions (12 models × 7 tasks).
5 Results
RQ1: Is there a tradeoff between ensuring item-fairness in rankings
and maintaining high ranking quality when utility labels are used
for evaluation?
By gathering all four repeated runs of the experiments with
different 𝛼 values, we can plot the trend of ranking quality (EE-R)
against item fairness (EE-D), as shown in Figure 4a.
As shown in previous studies [ 11, 56], there is a well-known
tradeoff between fairness and ranking quality for human users.
Similarly, we observe a general tradeoff for machine users. However,
unlike past findings, this tradeoff is not always strict. For instance,
in Figure 4a, both SPLADE and Contriever maintain consistently
high ranking quality while being considerably fairer, and for BM25,
ranking quality even improves as fairness increases, up to a certain
point.

Table 1: Comparison of fairness-ranking quality tradeoff
(slope) and ranking quality (AUC) metrics for LaMP-1 and
LaMP-4 datasets.
At the rightmost side of the lines, where EE-D = 1 (representing
the performance of deterministic rankers), we observe that these
rankers do not always deliver the highest ranking quality. This
suggests that commonly used deterministic rankers in RAG systems
may be suboptimal, and that ranking quality can be improved while
ensuring item fairness. This becomes even clearer when examining
the impact of fair ranking on the downstream performance of a
RAG system.
The leftmost side of the lines, where EE-D = 0, represents the
performance of a uniformly random ranking policy. At this point,
the measured ranking quality should approximate the proportion of
positively labeled items in the corpus, which is 31% for LaMP task
4. This is notably higher than in non-RAG (human-user) settings,
where the percentage of relevant documents is typically much
smaller, resulting in a EE-R value near 0 [11].
To quantify the tradeoff, we fit a linear line to the experiment
results, where a steeper slope reflects a stronger tradeoff between
fairness and ranking quality (slope). We also quantify the perfor-
mance of fair rankers, by calculating the area under the disparity-
ranking quality curve (AUC; Figure 4a). As can be seen in Table
1, we observe that retriever that yields higher ranking quality has
higher tradeoff in terms of retrieval fairness.
RQ2: Is there a tradeoff between ensuring item-fairness in ranking
and maintaining high generation quality of a RAG model?
Before examining the relationship between fairness and RAG
utility, Figure 4b shows an auxiliary result confirming a strong cor-
relation between utility-based ranking quality and the effectiveness
of RAG models. This is unsurprising, as item-worthiness judgments
were based on the utility-gain provided by the generator. However,
this correlation suggests that the tradeoff observed in the disparity-
ranking quality curve (Figure 4a) is likely to manifest similarly due
to this strong relationship.
In fact, as observed from the disparity-utility curve (Figure 4c),
we see a global trend of a non-strict tradeoff (i.e., RAG models
maintain high generation quality while being considerably fair, and
often even achieve higher quality).
However, a closer look at the local trend offers a significant
insight: RAG systems with fair ranking can often achieve higher
system-effectiveness compared to models with deterministic rankers.
In Table 2, we divided the fairness levels into five disparity intervals
based on the normalized EE-D. As shown in the table , improving
fairness to the level ofEE-D ∈ [ 0.8, 1.0), and even EE-D ∈ [ 0.6, 0.8),
can often enhance the expected utility of many RAG models across
LaMP tasks. For example, having EE-D in the range of [0.8, 1.0)
outperforms the baseline for all models in LaMP-4 and for eight
out of twelve models in LaMP-1.
Significance testing results in Table 2 provide additional nuance.
The range EE-D ∈ [ 0.0, 0.2) shows a statistically significant drop in

utility compared to the baseline, indicating that pushing disparity
to extremely low levels can indeed reduce performance. Beyond
this small-disparity range ( EE-D ∈ [ 0.2, 1.0)), the differences in
utility scores from the baseline either remain statistically insignifi-
cant or—when significant—reflect improved utility. This suggests
that models can maintain a level of retrieval fairness close to the
baseline’s utility performance without incurring a notable cost, and
may even achieve higher effectiveness in many cases.
RQ3: What is the impact of item-fairness in ranking to the fairness
of the attributed sources used in the final response?
To address this, we analyze three primary relationships: (1) how
retrieval fairness (EE-D) relates to the expected attribution rate
(EAR), (2) how ranking quality (EE-R) interacts with EAR, and (3)
how retrieval fairness translates into consumption fairness (EAE-D)
in the final output.
Figures 5a and 5b together shed light on how many items are
actually attributed by the generator, which is a vital step in under-
standing how exposure might become more or less equitable once
the generator has consumed the retrieved items. Figure 5a shows
that when retrieval becomes more fair (lower EE-D), the generator
tends to attribute fewer items overall, suggesting a tradeoff between
distributing items equitably and actually getting them used in the
final output.
Interestingly, the general shape ofEE-D versus EAR in Figure 5a
aligns closely with the shape of EE-D versus EE-R in Figure 4a. By
looking at Figure 5b, it becomes clear that the generator is more
likely to use multiple items if they are useful in solving the task,
reflecting the idea that high-quality rankings encourage higher
EAR.

Figure 5: Major relationships between retrieval fairness (RetDisparity), ranking quality, expected attribution rate, and consump-
tion fairness (AttDisparity). We empirically show that there is a tradeoff between retrieval fairness and expected attribution
rate as there is a positive relationship between ranking quality and attribution rate. Most importantly, we show that retrieval
fairness does not necessarily directly propagate to the consumption fairness due to varying attribution rate of a generator. The
same interpolation methods are used as Figure 4 and runs were averaged across generators. RetDisparity refers to the disparity
among retrieved items, while AttDisparity refers to the disparity among attributed sources.
Figure 5c directly addresses the question of whether fair retrieval
leads to fair consumption by comparing EE-D (retrieval fairness)
to EAE-D (consumption fairness ). 6 The positive trend suggests
that a more equitable ranking generally produces a more equitable
distribution of attributed items in the final generation. However,
the diagonal line (y=x) reveals subtle differences between fairness
at the ranking stage and fairness at the consumption stage. Data
points falling below this line imply that consumption is even fairer
than the initial ranking might predict, while points above it suggest
that the generator’s selective usage of items has introduced new
disparity. This pattern shifts depending on how relevant and useful
the retrieved items are, mirroring the earlier observation (Figure 5b)
that the generator favors content that supports solving the task. In
cases where many items have only marginal utility, the generator’s
emphasis on a few high-utility sources can inadvertently raise
disparity, placing the plotted values above the y=x line.
6 Discussion
6.1 Higher System Utility with Fair Rankings
Although there is a general trend of a fairness-utility tradeoff, we
observe that certain levels of fairness can actually improve the util-
ity of a baseline RAG model. Recent line of research have uncovered
relevant findings: 1) generators are not robust to changes in the
position of useful information [
34]; 2) items with high retrieval
scores often include distracting content that can reduce the system-
effectiveness [10, 47]; and 3) introducing some random documents
can significantly boost the utility of RAG [10].
Building on these existing results, we find that perturbing the
initial ranking through stochastic sampling often can impact the
performance of certain inference decisions and lead to changes
6Normalized EE-D and EAE-D scores are directly comparable, as they share the same
dimensions in their exposure vectors and have the same 𝑙1 norm.
in the system’s expected end-performance. In our experiments,
we observe that the expected utility generally increases within the
fairness interval of [0.8, 1.0). This suggests that a fixed ranking from
a deterministic ranker may be suboptimal for the generator, and
that perturbing the ranking, along with the repositioning of items,
not only improves expected end-performance but also enhances
the fairness of the rankings.
Moreover, in fairness intervals where the system’s expected
utility improves, it is possible that either fewer distracting items
were included in the ranking passed to the generator or useful,
previously overlooked items (which may have been considered
random) were introduced due to the ranking perturbation. How-
ever, while higher utility paired with increased item-fairness (even
within fairness intervals as low as [0.4, 0.6)) may seem advanta-
geous, practitioners should exercise caution. This could result in
compensating providers of items irrelevant to user requests, par-
ticularly in scenarios where content providers are rewarded for
contributing to inference outcomes.
6.2 Attribution Rate and Consumption Fairness
RAG practitioners should consider both the expected utility (EU) of
the generated text and the expected attributed exposure disparity
(EAE-D) to ensure a balance between utility and fairness in the
system’s output. Achieving this balance requires careful adjust-
ment of retrieval fairness to find an interval where the generated
content remains both useful and fair in its exposure of sources. One
important metric to monitor in this process is the attribution rate,
which reflects the proportion of retrieved items that are actually
cited or used in the final output.
Monitoring expected attribution rate (EAR) provides valuable in-
sights for understanding how fairness manifests in the final output,
offering an essential complement to EAE-D. For example, even if
a ranking appears fair at the retrieval stage, a low attribution rate
40
Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation ICTIR ’25, July 18, 2025, Padua, Italy
indicates that the generator ultimately utilizes only a small subset
of the retrieved items, which can amplify disparities among the at-
tributed sources. In such cases, fairness concerns at the generation
stage may outweigh those at the retrieval stage. Conversely, when
the generator attributes a larger portion of the retrieved set, dispar-
ities among the attributed sources may become less pronounced,
as the system distributes attention more evenly across a broader
set of items.
By comparing expected attribution rate with consumption fair-
ness, practitioners can better disentangle the root causes of imbal-
ances in the final output. Specifically, they can determine whether
disparities stem from the retrieval stage, such as an inherently
skewed ranking, or from the generator’s behavior in selectively
focusing on only a few documents. This comparison can help di-
agnose fairness issues more effectively, enabling practitioners to
refine both retrieval and generation components of a RAG system
to achieve more equitable outcomes in the generated content.
6.3 Measuring Consumption Fairness
Ensuring consumption fairness while maintaining high utility of
the generated text is a fundamental objective in building a fair RAG
system. To achieve this, we measure the exposure of the final at-
tributed items, as these are the items that human users will actually
encounter in the system’s output. This approach aligns with the
real-world operation of RAG systems, particularly in applications
like conversational QA or domain-specific assistants for general
information or shopping, where the generated text is accompanied
by explicitly cited documents or attributed items. In such cases,
measuring the fair exposure of the attributed items is critical, as
consumption fairness can have a more direct impact on users com-
pared to retrieval fairness, given that human users only consume
what is explicitly surfaced by the system.
A key factor in accurately evaluating exposure-based retrieval
fairness is the development of sophisticated machine-user browsing
models. The work of Liu et al. [34] provides valuable insights for
designing such advanced browsing models. In our experiments, we
employed encoder-decoder models with a short retrieval context
to get close to the assumption that equal attention is given to all
top-
𝑘 retrieved items [ 34]. However, as the use of long-context
becomes prevalent, accurately measuring exposure-based retrieval
fairness becomes more challenging due to the generator’s tendency
to allocate unequal attention to different items.
Despite these challenges, it is important to highlight that mea-
suring consumption fairness is not dependent on machine-user
browsing models. Unlike retrieval fairness, consumption fairness
can be measured effectively in long-context models, regardless
of how attentions are distributed across items by the generators.
Therefore, focusing on consumption fairness ensures that the eval-
uation remains robust, even in scenarios where exposure patterns
vary significantly across different models.
6.4 Measurement of String Utility
In line with the recent call for evaluating various valid output
strings [
63], we recognize the need for a similar approach to bet-
ter measure system utility across different rankings given. Recall
that our experiments were designed to provide the generator with
different rankings for the same query, leading to varied outputs.
This approach is motivated by the idea that items not appearing
in the top positions of deterministic rankings may still hold value
and should be fairly considered by the system. In this context, the
diverse outputs generated from different rankings may still be valid.
However, we currently rely on a single target output string for
comparison with predictions. Future work could focus on calcu-
lating the utility of diffuse predictions, enabling a more nuanced
evaluation.
6.5 Limitations
We acknowledge that the evaluation cost of fair RAG systems can
be high due to repeated sampling and inference steps. However, in
production, only a single ranking is sampled, minimizing the impact
on system latency. Also, a limitation in our utility labeling is that it
considers single items, while multiple items may yield contrasting
utility gains. Despite this, the strong correlation between ranking
quality and system effectiveness suggests this approach reasonably
approximates item-worthiness for evaluating the impact of fair
ranking on RAG systems.
Another limitation lies in the ability to capture the exposure
of items beyond those retrieved by the system. Since it is difficult
to verify attribution across the entire corpus, our method focuses
on measuring the exposure fairness of the attributed sources (e.g.,
those explicitly cited in the generated output). While this approach
does not account for the broader set of potential exposures, it is
useful for common RAG applications where the attributed sources
are directly displayed to users. In such cases, ensuring fairness
among these sources is critical, as they are likely to be the primary
content users engage with.
7 Conclusion
This study highlights the impact of fair rankings not only on the
ranking and generation quality of RAG systems but also on the eq-
uitable attribution of sources in the final output. Through extensive
analysis, we demonstrate that fairer RAG models can maintain—and
in some cases even surpass—the generation quality of traditional
approaches, challenging the assumption of an inherent tradeoff
between fairness and effectiveness. Our findings emphasize the
importance of fair attribution, showing how improvements at the
retrieval stage translate into more equitable exposure of the sources
that appear in the generated text. By addressing disparities in both
retrieval and attribution, we provide valuable insights for develop-
ing responsible and equitable RAG systems.
In future work, we hope to extend this framework to consider
graded or missing judgments and exploring the different notions
