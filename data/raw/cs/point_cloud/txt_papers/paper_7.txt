PointCloud-Text Matching: Benchmark Dataset and
Baseline
Yanglin Feng, Yang Qin, Dezhong Peng, Hongyuan Zhu, Xi Peng and Peng Hu
Abstract—In this paper, we present and study a new instance-
level retrieval task: PointCloud-Text Matching (PTM), which
aims to identify the exact cross-modal instance that matches
a given point-cloud query or text query. PTM has potential
applications in various scenarios, such as indoor/urban-canyon lo-
calization and scene retrieval. However, there is a lack of suitable
and targeted datasets for PTM in practice. To address this issue,
we present a new PTM benchmark dataset, namely SceneDepict-
3D2T. We observe that the data poses significant challenges due to
its inherent characteristics, such as the sparsity, noise, or disorder
of point clouds and the ambiguity, vagueness, or incompleteness
of texts, which render existing cross-modal matching methods
ineffective for PTM. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
PTM baseline, named Robust PointCloud-Text Matching method
(RoMa). RoMa consists of two key modules: a Dual Attention
Perception module (DAP) and a Robust Negative Contrastive
Learning module (RNCL). Specifically, DAP leverages token-
level and feature-level attention mechanisms to adaptively focus
on useful local and global features, and aggregate them into
common representations, thereby reducing the adverse impact
of noise and ambiguity. To handle noisy correspondence, RNCL
enhances robustness against mismatching by dividing negative
pairs into clean and noisy subsets and assigning them forward
and reverse optimization directions, respectively. We conduct
extensive experiments on our benchmarks and demonstrate the
superiority of our RoMa.

language queries, named PointCloud-Text Matching (PTM).
The instance-level alignment is challenging and realistic as
it reflects the need for precise and relevant information to
build alignment between point clouds and texts in real-world
applications, which has potential applications in indoor/urban-
canyon localization, scene retrieval, and more.
Existing methods, however, struggle and lack pertinence to
tackle PTM. On one hand, existing PointCloud-Text Retrieval
(PTR) methods [5], [6] only focus on establishing category-
level correspondence between 3D point-cloud shapes and short
annotation texts as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In contrast, PTM
requires exploiting the mutual information of cross-modal
pairs, and achieves instance-level alignment between point-
cloud scenes and detailed descriptions as shown in Fig. 1 (b).
This indicates that PTM demands the ability to capture local
features and instance discrimination, rendering the existing
methods inapplicable. On the other hand, existing cross-
modal matching works that can build instance-level cross-
modal correspondence are only primarily oriented to text
and 2D image modalities. According to the granularity of
the established correspondence, these cross-modal matching
works could be divided into two groups: coarse-grained and
fine-grained matching methods. The former [7]–[9] use global
features to represent the whole image and the whole text,
while the latter [10]–[12] use local features to capture the
fine-grained details of regions and words. Although these
methods have achieved promising performance for image-text
matching task, most of them ignore the specific properties and

challenges in PTM.
To the best of our knowledge, the insufficient informa-
tion provided by existing datasets makes them unsuitable
for PTM. To be specific, descriptions in most datasets (e.g.,
ScanRefer [13], Nr3d [14] primarily focus on portraying a
single object for visual grounding and captioning, and a few
other (e.g., LLM-3D-Scene [15]) describing several objects
in isolation within the corresponding scenes. These limited
descriptions match precisely with the corresponding wide-
field point clouds, as demonstrated by the dismal matching
performance in existing datasets depicted in Fig. 2. Therefore,
we constitute a new benchmark dataset for PTM, namely
SceneDepict-3D2T. The dataset contains comprehensive de-
scriptions covering entire 3D point-cloud scenes, so they
evaluate baselines more reliably and reasonably for PTM,
which can be observed in Fig. 2. We also provide a compre-
hensive evaluation protocol and several benchmark results for
PTM on the datasets as shown in Table I. From the results,
we observe that point cloud-text data are more challenging
than the common image-text data due to the sparsity, noise,
or disorder of point clouds [16]. More specifically, these
properties make it difficult to capture and integrate local and
global semantic features from both point clouds and texts
and may also lead to mismatched cross-modal pairs, i.e.,
noisy correspondence [17], [18], thus degrading the retrieval
performance. The schematic illustration of the challenges is
shown in Fig. 1 (c). To be specific, the existing coarse-grained
matching methods fail to extract discriminative global features
from the unordered point clouds and vague texts, and the fine-
grained matching methods that rely on well-detected object
regions cannot be generalizable to point clouds. Moreover,
most existing methods are based on well-annotated data and
are susceptible to overfitting noisy correspondence, resulting
in performance degradation. Therefore, there is a significant
gap in applying existing methods to PTM.
To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose a PTM
baseline, named Robust PointCloud-Text Matching method
(RoMa), to learn from point clouds and texts as illustrated
in Fig. 7. RoMa consists of two modules: a Dual Attention
Perception module (DAP) and a Robust Negative Contrastive
Learning module (RNCL). DAP is proposed to adaptively
capture and integrate the local and global informative features
to alleviate the impact of noise and ambiguity in the data.
More specifically, DAP conducts token-level and feature-level
attention to adaptively weigh the patches and words to multi-
grainly aggregate the local and global discriminative features
into common representations, thus embracing a comprehensive
perception. In addition, our RNCL is presented to adaptively
divide the negative pairs into clean and noisy subsets based
on the similarity within pairs, and then assign them with
forward and reverse optimization directions respectively. Dif-
ferent from traditional contrastive learning, our RNCL only
leverages negative pairs rather than positive pairs to train the
model since negatives are much less error-prone than positive
pairs, leading to robustness against noisy correspondence. In
brief, our RNCL could utilize and focus on more reliable pairs
to enhance the robustness.
In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
• We investigate a new instance-level cross-modal retrieval
task, namely PointCloud-Text Matching (PTM), and pro-
pose a PTM benchmark dataset SceneDepict-3D2T and
a robust baseline RoMa to learn from challenging multi-
modal data for PTM.
• We present a novel Dual Attention Perception module
(DAP) that adaptively extracts and integrates the local
and global features into common representations by using
token-level and feature-level attention, thereby achieving
a comprehensive perception of semantic features.
• To handle noisy correspondence, we devise a Robust
Negative Contrastive Learning module (RNCL) that adap-
tively identifies clean and noisy negative pairs, and as-
signs them correct optimization directions accordingly,
thus preventing the model from overfitting noise.
• We conduct extensive comparison experiments on four
pointcloud-text datasets. Our RoMa remarkably outper-
forms the existing methods without bells and whistles,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.
II. R ELATED WORK
A. Cross-modal Retrieval
Cross-modal retrieval aims to search the relevant results
across different modalities for a given query, e.g., image-text
matching [8], [11], 2D-3D retrieval [22], [23], and visible-
infrared re-identification [24], etc. Most of these works learn
a joint common embedding space by applying cross-modal
constraints [25], [26], which aims to pull relevant cross-
modal samples close while pushing the irrelevant ones apart.
These methods could roughly be classified into two groups:
1) Coarse-grained retrieval [7], [8], [21], [27], [28] typically
learns shared subspaces to build connections between global-
level representations, which align images and texts in a direct
manner. 2) Fine-grained retrieval [11], [20], [29] aims to
model cross-modal associations between local feature repre-
sentations, e.g., the visual-semantic associations between word
tokens and image regions. Unlike them, in this paper, we
delve into a less-touched and more challenging cross-modal
scenario, i.e., Pointcloud-Text Matching (PTM), which argues
for building cross-modal associations between 3D space and
textual space.

B. 3D Vision and Language
In contrast to image and language comprehension, 3D vision
and language comprehension represent a relatively nascent
frontier in research. Most existing works focus on using lan-
guage to confine individual objects, e.g., distinguishing objects
according to phrases [30] or detecting individual objects [31].
With the introduction of the ScanNet [32], ScanRefer [13],
and Nr3d [14] datasets, more works have expanded their focus
to encompass the 3D scenes. Some existing works [33], [34]
have tried to locate objects within scenes based on linguistic
descriptions, completing the task of 3D visual grounding.
Recently, with the introduction of Scan2Cap [35], some ef-
forts [36] focus on providing descriptions for objects about
their placement. This is also known as 3D dense captioning.
Recently, a few preliminary solutions [5], [6] for pointcloud-
text retrieval have begun to emerge, which only establish
common discrimination for coarse category-level alignment
between point-cloud shapes and brief category label texts.
However, these category-level methods could not be migrated
to PTM. There are still scarce methods focusing on instance-
level alignment and matching between wide-field point clouds
and natural language texts, which requires excavating more
detailed and discriminative connections within cross-modal
pairs.
III. P OINT CLOUD -T EXT MATCHING
In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D vision and language
task, namely PointCloud-Text Matching (PTM). The input
cross-modal data of the task involves the 3D point clouds and
free-form description texts. The goal of PTM is to support bi-
directional retrieval between point clouds and corresponding
texts, achieving instance-level cross-modal alignment.
However, the task presents notable discrepancies and task-
specific challenges, which can be summarized as follows:
• Perceiving local and global semantic features is hard.
Since sensor sampling characteristics and biases, point
clouds are commonly presented as a collection of sparse,
noisy, and unordered points. Compared to 2D images,
point clouds encapsulate a wealth of additional objects
and spatial properties, which results in more incomplete
and ambiguous description texts. Such complexity makes
it harder for existing models to accurately perceive local
and global semantic features from both modalities.
• Noisy correspondence. Imperfect annotations are ubiq-
uitous, even well-labeled datasets containing latent noisy
labels, as shown by the existence of over 100,000 label
issues in the ImageNet [37] and 3%-20% annotation
errors in the Conceptual Captions [38]. However, due to
the limitations of human perception and description of 3D
space, annotation workers are unintentionally inclined to
use vague expressions (such as ‘near’, ‘close to’, etc.)
to describe the details of the point clouds incorrectly,
introducing more correspondence annotation (i.e., noisy
correspondence). Such noise would lead to insufficient
learning or noise overfitting for existing models.

Fig. 3: Word clouds of objects, colors, spatial information, and
shape material in the descriptions of SceneDepict-3D2T.
To the best of our knowledge, existing multi-modal datasets
of point clouds and texts can not apply directly to PointCloud-
Text Matching (PTM). On the one hand, the descriptions in
most of these datasets (e.g., ScanRefer [13], Nr3d [14], and
ScanQA [39]) are confined to single objects of the entire point-
cloud scenes. Fig. 6 shows they only have average lengths of
fewer than 15 words and each description encompasses fewer
than 2 objects. However, one scene typically contains 10-30
objects [32], with many similar objects present across differ-
ent scenes. This indicates that these short and inadequately
informative descriptions are prone to be ambiguous, lacking
the discrimination to meet the requirements of PTM. On the
other hand, although several scene description datasets [15] for
scene understanding with the Large Language Model (LLM)
have been recently proposed, they exhibit limited data volume
and lack inter-object relationships necessary for a compre-
hensive description for each specific scene. These limitations
hinder their application in PTM, as shown in Fig. 6. We
conduct PTM experiments on these existing datasets, and the
matching results in Fig. 2 show that the average performance
of the latest cross-modal matching methods in terms of Recall
at 1 is less than 10%, confirming the above view.
To establish a reasonable evaluation of PTM with prac-
tical significance, we construct a diverse, detailed, and dis-
criminative benchmark dataset with scene-level descriptions
for comprehensive point-cloud scene understanding, namely
SceneDepict-3D2T. In SceneDepict-3D2T, the point-cloud
data is all based on the ScanNet [32] dataset, and the text
data is derived from the ScanRefer [13], Nr3d [14], and
ScanQA [39] description sets associated with ScanNet. In the
following sections, we will elaborate on the collection and
statistics of our proposed datasets.
A. Data Collection
We deploy a prompt-driven LLM paradigm to generate
scene-level descriptions of point-cloud scene scans in ScanNet,
leveraging three existing object-level description datasets (i.e.,
ScanRefer, Nr3d, and ScanQA). The description generation
pipeline is divided into three stages, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
1) Scene Analysis Stage: We first divide each scene scan into
multiple neighborhoods and identify discriminative objects
based on their color, size, and more. We then randomly select
n descriptions of n spatially related objects from different
neighborhoods, creating object-level description collection.
This stage arbitrarily introduces different object characteristics
that guide the generated descriptions to encapsulate varied
information and scene discrimination of point clouds.

2) Data Generation Stage : In this stage, we randomly
select one of the three object-level datasets and input the
corresponding object-level description collection into the LLM
using the tailored prompts to generate scene-level descriptions.
The designed prompts align with the various linguistic char-
acteristics of different datasets, ensuring the language style
diversity and applicability of PTM across various scenarios.
Specifically, for ScanRefer, the generated descriptions are
objective and exhaustive, being suitable for scenarios with
precise matching of the object placement throughout the scans.
For Nr3d, the descriptions are concise and informative, being
applicable for scenarios with matching of partial arrangement
of objects within scans. For ScanQA, the descriptions detail
object characteristics and relationships, which are suitable for
scenarios with matching of key features of scans.
3) Verification Stage : In this final stage, we manually
assess each generated description for discriminative accuracy,
grammatical correctness, and coherence, completing the scene-
level description construction.
Repeating the above process ten times, we generate ten
unique scene-level descriptions for each point cloud. By
following this process for all point clouds, we create the
SceneDepict-3D2T dataset. Note that more construction details
and data examples are provided in the Appendix.
B. Dataset Statistics
To provide a comprehensive overview of the proposed
SceneDepict-3D2T dataset, we present data distribution statis-
tics and compare it with those of existing datasets, as depicted
in Figs. 5 and 6.
More specifically, the corpus adopted for description gen-
erating is evenly sourced from the datasets with distinct lin-
guistic styles, showcasing the comprehensiveness of the con-
structed descriptions. Additionally, our SceneDepict-3D2T of-
fers a wealth of grammatical scene-level descriptions suitable
for PTM training and validation. On average, each description
in SceneDepict-3D2T covers 10.7 objects and 8.8 object
categories, which is over 5 times more than the object-level
datasets (i.e., ScanRefer, Nr3d, and ScanQA). Furthermore,
each description encompasses 6.6 inter-object interactions,
which is 6.6 times higher than in the scene description dataset
3D-LLM-Scene. This demonstrates the sufficient scene cov-
erage and discrimination of the descriptions in SceneDepict-
3D2T. In addition, the descriptions in SceneDepict-3D2T are

rich in color (85.8%), material (38.7%), shape terms (56.1%),
and spatial information (99.0%), ensuring their informational
depth. Consequently, benefiting from the discriminative and
detailed descriptions in SceneDepict-3D2T, baselines can
achieve 100% to 400% improvement in PTM performance
compared to existing datasets, as shown in Fig. 2, underscoring
its practical significance for PTM.
Despite meticulous verification efforts to improve the gram-
matical accuracy and syntactic coherence of the datasets, it
is unavoidable to introduce a considerable portion of noisy
correspondence because of the inherent nature of unordered
point-cloud scenes and vague free-form descriptions. To assess
this, we randomly selected 100 descriptions from SceneDepict-
3D2T and manually checked for vague expressions that might
lead to noisy correspondence. Eventually, 13 descriptions
were flagged for potential issues. Thus, noisy correspondence
remains an unavoidable challenge in PTM, which could result
in noise overfitting, leading to performance degradation.

A. Problem Formulation
We first define the notations for a lucid presentation. Give
a PTM dataset D = {P, T }, where P = {X p
i }Np
i=1 and
T = {X t
j }Nt
j=1 are the point-cloud and text sets respectively,
Np and Nt are the size of P and T , X p
i is the ith point-
cloud sample and X t
j is the jth text sample. There is pairwise
correspondence between P and T , so D can also be written
as D = {(X p
i , Xt
j), yi,j}Np,Nt
i,j , yi,j ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether
X p
i and X t
j are matched (i.e., positive pair, yi,j = 1 ) or
unmatched (i.e., negative pair, yi,j = 0). However, in practice,
the unmatched pairs (yi,j = 0) may be mislabeled as matched
ones ( yi,j = 1), a.k.a noisy correspondence.
In the data encoding stage, we first employ modality-specific
backbones (i.e., fp and ft) to extract token-wise features for
the patches of point clouds and words of descriptions, i.e.,
Z p
i = fp(X p
i ) ∈ Rpn×dc and Z t
j = ft(X t
j) ∈ Rtn×dc,
respectively. Z p
i and Z t
j are the token-wise feature sets of ith
point cloud and jth text, pn and tn are the number of tokens
for each sample and dc is the dimensionality of the feature
space.
In addition, to preserve spacial interactions across patches
within point clouds, inspired by the sequence position rep-
resentation [40], we attempt to encapsulate the 2D position

To tackle the task-specific challenges mentioned earlier,
a robust PTM method (RoMa) is proposed to learn cross-
modal associations from point clouds and texts as shown
in Fig. 7. The proposed method involves two modules: 1)
Dual Attention Perception (DAP) is used to comprehensively
perceive semantic features with dual attention at the dataset
level, and 2) Robust Negative Contrastive Learning (RNCL)
is exploited to handle noisy correspondence. In the following
sections, we will elaborate on each component of RoMa.
B. Dual Attention Perception
To tackle the challenge of capturing and integrating both
local and global semantic features from point clouds and
texts in PTM, we propose a novel dual attention mechanism.
More specifically, similar to the definition in Self-Attention
mechanism (SA) [40], we calculate the Queries Qp
i ∈ Rpn×dc,
Qt
i ∈ Rtn×dc, along with the Values V p
i ∈ Rpn×dc, V t
j ∈
Rtn×dc of two modalities from the ith point-cloud and jth
text features Z p
i and Z t
j, using the fully connected layers gp
and gt, respectively. However, unlike SA, our dual attention
mechanism constructs learnable token-level and feature-level
Generic-Keys, which are shared across all samples in the
dataset. Benefit from this, the Generic-Keys could learn to
model general patterns of tokens and features throughout
the entire dataset. By integrating these Generic-Keys with
the sample-specific Queries, our method achieves more com-
prehensive attention than SA, capturing interactions beyond
token-wise relationships within individual samples, as depicted
in Fig. 7 (b).
To be more specific, to facilitate the adaptive exploration of
local semantic features, we first construct token-level Generic-
Keys ¯K p ∈ Rdc and ¯K t ∈ Rdc upon the feature matrices
of point-cloud and text modalities. We use them to model
the common patterns of informative tokens (i.e., patches and
words) within each modality. Similar to SA, we obtain token-
level attention by measuring the token-wise similarity between
Queries and token-level Generic-Keys, empowering the model
to selectively focus on local key semantic units similar to
the common patterns in the two modalities (e.g., foreground
patches in the point clouds and keywords in the texts), which
are written as:
¯ap
i = φ((Qp
i + Ei) ¯K p⊤), ¯at
i = φ(Qt
i ¯K t⊤), (4)
where ¯ap
i ∈ Rpn and ¯at
i ∈ Rtn are the token-level attention
vectors, φ is the Softmax operation along the token dimen-
sion (i.e., row-wise operation on the feature matrices). It is
worth noting that we add patch position embedding in point-
cloud modality to preserve the spatial interactions among
patches. Based on this, we obtain the token-level attention
¯Ap
i ∈ Rpn×dc and ¯At
i ∈ Rtn×dc by stacking these attention
vectors in the feature dimension.
In addition, we propose feature-level attention to cap-
ture feature semantics and enhanced cross-modal representa-
tions. Similar to token-level modeling, we introduce learnable
feature-level Generic-Keys ˆK p ∈ Rdc×dc and ˆK t ∈ Rdc×dc
for two modalities, which aims to model the interaction pat-
terns among dc features. We construct feature-level attention
by combining Queries and feature-level Generic-Keys to grasp
global discriminative features from the dimensional interre-
lationships in the feature space, such as distinctive object

Fig. 7: The illustration of our proposed method. (a) shows the pipeline of our RoMa, which involves two modules: Dual Attention
Perception (DAP) and Robust Negative Contrastive Learning (RNCL). In DAP, comprehensive common representations could be
extracted from both modalities and then matched into negative pairs. In RNCL, these negative pairs are adaptively optimized in
both forward and reverse directions based on pairwise similarities, enhancing the robustness and discrimination of the common
representations. (b) is the schematic illustration of DAP in point-cloud modality, which operates similarly for the text modality.
Query and Value are obtained from features through a fully connected layer (FC), while Generic-Key is general and learnable
for the whole dataset. The Query is combined with token-level and feature-level Generic-Key to obtain dual attention. Following
this, the features and attentions are aggregated into common representations.
color, position, orientation, spatial relationships, etc., which
is written as:
ˆAp
i = φ(Qp
i ˆK p⊤), ˆAt
i = φ(Qt
i ˆK t⊤), (5)
where ˆAp
i ∈ Rpn×dc and ˆAt
i ∈ Rtn×dc are the feature-level
attention.
Next, we aggregate the token-level and feature-level atten-
tion into dual attention, which can be written as:
Ap
i = ¯Ap
i ⊙ ˆAp
i , A t
i = ¯At
i ⊙ ˆAt

where Ap
i and At
i are dual attention in point-cloud and text
modalities, and the ⊙ is the Hadamard product operator.
Subsequently, we impose dual attention upon the Values,
aggregating them for integrated representations into common
space, which are written as:
pi = N orm( 1

and N orm(·) is the l2-normalization function. The common
representations pi ∈ Rdc and ti ∈ Rdc integrate local use-
ful semantics and global discriminative semantics, promoting
comprehensive feature perception in unordered point clouds
and ambiguous texts.
C. Robust Negative Contrastive Learning
Inspired by [41], we leverage the complementary contrastive
learning paradigm to learn with more reliable negative pairs in-
stead of positive pairs, thereby mitigating the negative impact
of mismatched pairs and achieving robust PTM against noisy
correspondence. The loss for the cross-modal complementary
learning paradigm is shown below:

only apply to negative pairs. Minimizing Eq. (9) could reduce
the similarity between the samples within negative pairs, in-
troducing common discrimination without relying on positive
pairs, which are more prone to containing some erroneous
information. Because of this, the model could alleviate the
impact of noisy correspondence.
However, due to the similarity in object categories within the
point-cloud scenes and limited differences across some parts of
scenes in PTM, samples within some negative pairs unavoid-
ably exhibit certain degrees of semantic similarity. Blindly and
monotonously amplifying the gap between two samples within
negative pairs would lead to error accumulation, thus impact-
ing the formation of robust discrimination. To address this
issue, we propose the Robust Negative Contrastive loss, which
could prevent the model from fitting these unreliable negative
pairs or even revise the wrong optimization direction. This

novel loss is non-monotonic and has a parameter-controlled
inflection point. It assesses the reliability of negative pairs
based on the similarity of the paired samples, dynamically
and implicitly divides negative pairs into clean and noisy
subsets based on their reliability by considering the inflection
point as a threshold, and assigns clean subsets with forward
optimization direction but provides noisy subsets with reverse
optimization direction, which could be formulated as:
L = Lp→t + Lt→p, (13)

Note that Lp→t and Lt→p are the point-cloud-to-text and text-
to-point-cloud loss terms of our Robust Negative Contrastive
loss respectively, and α is the parameter that controls the
inflection point. Take Lp→t for example, its gradient calcu-
lation formula can be written as ∂Lp→t/∂S p→t

that when Sp→t
i,j = 1 − e1−α, the loss has a inflection point.
As optimization progresses, clean negative pairs with low
similarity (i.e., Sp→t
i,j < 1 − e1−α) are still separated, while
pairs with high similarity (i.e., Sp→t
i,j > 1−e1−α) are identified
and brought closer, helping our RNCL filter out unreliable
negative pairs adaptively. Compared to the existing loss [44],
[45], our loss identifies and handles negative pairs, adaptively
driving the reliable negative pairs apart in the common space,
enhancing robustness against noisy correspondence in PTM.
VI. E XPERIMENTS
To thoroughly evaluate our RoMa for PTM, we conduct
extensive experiments on the proposed SceneDepict-3D2T
dataset and three other existing datasets.
A. Experimental Settings
In this work, our RoMa is implemented in PyTorch and
carried out on one GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. In the experi-
ments, we adopt the ScanNet [32] point-cloud set along with
four description sets (i.e., SceneDepict-3D2T, ScanRefer [13],
Nr3d [14], and 3D-LLM-Scene [15]), obtaining corresponding
four multi-modal datasets for PTM evaluation. Due to the
space restriction, the details of implementation and introduc-
tion to the adopted datasets could be found in the Appendix.
In the experiments, we compared our RoMa with 14 state-
of-the-art cross-modal matching methods, including VSE,
VSE++ [7], VSE∞ [8], SGR [11], NCR-SGR [17], SAF [11],
RCL-SAF [41], MV-VSE [42], NAAF [12], DIVE [19],
CHAN [20], ESA [43], HREM [21], and CRCL [9]. In the
implementations and evaluations of all the methods, we adhere
to the following settings. For point-cloud data processing, we
adopt the widely used DGCNN [46] to obtain patch-level fea-
tures. For text data processing, without loss of generality, we
follow the text processing strategy used in cross-modal match-
ing [8], [43] and employ both Bi-GRU [47] and BERT [48]
to acquire word-level features, respectively. We follow [17],
[29] to compute Recall at K (R@K) as the measurement of
performance. In the experiments on SceneDepict-3D2T, we
report R@1, R@5, R@10, and their sum to evaluate the
performance of the methods. Due to the text discrimination
limitations of other existing datasets (i.e., ScanRefer, Nr3d,
and LLM-3D-Scene), we report R@5, R@30, and their sum
to evaluate the methods more reasonably.
B. Comparison with the State-of-the-Arts
We conduct extensive PTM experiments on four datasets to
evaluate the performance of our RoMa and the baselines. The
experimental results are reported in Tables I and II. These re-
sults could yield the following observations: 1) General cross-
modal matching methods exhibit inadequate performance. This
substantiates the presence of distinct and more formidable
challenges in PTM, indicating the difficulty of effectively
applying these methods in PTM. 2) Some fine-grained methods

(e.g., SGR and SAF) suffered from severe performance issues
in PTM. By combining these methods with robust modules,
such as NCR-SGR and RCL-SAF, the performance could be
remarkably improved. These results indicate that there is a
large amount of noisy correspondence in PTM, which leads
to the performance degradation of the non-robust methods. 3)
Our RoMa achieves remarkably better results than the existing
cross-modal matching methods (e.g., CRCL, HERM, etc.),
demonstrating its superior effectiveness by conquering the two
challenges in PTM. 4) In existing datasets, the relevant results
matched by most methods rank only outside the top 5, proving
the scene-specific discrimination of these datasets is limited.
5) The performance on SceneDepict-3D2T is relatively low,
compared to the existing Image-Text datasets, where the state-
of-the-art performance usually exceeds 80 [21], [43], in terms
of R@1. This indicates that the PTM task still faces difficulties
in handling unordered point clouds, vague texts, and noisy
correspondence, and calls for more advanced solutions.
C. Ablation Study
In this section, we conduct an ablation study to investi-
gate the contribution of each proposed component to PTM.
Firstly, we replace the DAP module with the GPO [7] and
ESA [43] feature extraction modules, and the Robust Negative
Contrastive loss (i.e., L) adopted by RNCL with the vanilla
loss adopted by complementary contrastive learning paradigm
(i.e., L′) [41] and Contrastive loss (i.e., Lc). In addition, we
alternately replace patch position embedding E, token-level
attention ¯A, and feature-level attention ˆA to fairly verify their
effectiveness under the premise of eliminating the influence of
the number of learnable parameters. All the comparisons are
conducted on SceneDepict-3D2T with the same experimental
settings. The results are presented in Table III. From the table,
we could draw the following observation: 1) RoMa without
any component will drop matching performance, which indi-
cates that each component contributes to our method. 2) The
performances of adopting the L are superior to Lc that is
widely applied in well-annotated scenarios and L′. This proves
the presence of a considerable amount of noisy correspondence
in PTM and the L adopted by RNCL contributes to the
enhanced robustness of our RoMa. 3) DAP without any one
of attention and positional embedding will decrease matching
performance, demonstrating that each component in DAP

Fig. 9: Some matched instances of PTM on SceneDepict-3D2T. For each text query, the top-1 ranked point cloud are displayed.
The correctly matched point clouds are marked with a green tick, otherwise the red cross. In addition, we visualize the text
after applying attention and present a comparison between the original point clouds and the point cloud after applying attention.
Redder words and patches indicate higher attention weights.

PTM against different hyper-parameters (i.e., α, and τ) on
SceneDepict-3D2T as shown in Fig. 8. The results indicate that
our method achieves superior matching performance across a
range of α and τ values. Notably, when α is set too low, the
threshold for distinguishing between clean and noisy negative
pairs becomes excessively small. This leads to a significant
number of negative pairs being misclassified as noise and
subjected to reverse optimization, resulting in remarkable
performance degradation. Conversely, if α is too high, the
RNCL struggles to differentiate potential noisy negative pairs,
causing error accumulation and degraded performance.
E. Visualization Analysis
To provide a comprehensive insight into the effectiveness
exhibited by our RoMa, we conduct visualization experiments
in PTM. Firstly, to shed light on the reasons behind the
superior performance of our RoMa, we illustrate a small
handful of matching results and token-level attention visual-
ization throughout the point clouds and texts on SceneDepict-
3D2T dataset, as shown in Fig. 9. Additionally, we present a
performance comparison among our RoMa and the VSE∞ [8],
HREM [21], and CRCL [9] throughout the training process,
as shown in Fig. 10. From the results, we could draw the
following observations: 1) Our RoMa can achieve correct
retrieved results in PTM. Even the mismatched pair still
exhibits a strong cross-modal semantic correlation. This is
attributed to our DAP, which actually focuses on useful and
discriminative patches and words. 2) Throughout the whole
learning process, it is evident that non-robust baselines (i.e.,
VSE∞ and HREM) involve performance degradation in the
later training stage, impacted by the noisy correspondence. In
contrast, our RoMa mitigates the negative impact comprehen-
sively, achieving superior and robust performance.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce a novel yet challenging task,
named PointCloud-Text Matching (PTM). To facilitate the
research on this promising task, we construct a benchmark
dataset, namely SceneDepict-3D2T. We also propose a robust
baseline, named Robust PointCloud-Text Matching method
(RoMa), which consists of two novel modules: Dual Attention
Perception module (DAP) and Robust Negative Contrastive
Learning module (RNCL). Specifically, DAP leverages dual
attention mechanisms to capture local and global features of
point clouds and texts. In addition, RNCL is employed to
handle noisy correspondence by distinguishing and endowing
clean and noisy negative pairs with correct optimization di-
rections. We conducted extensive experiments compared to 14
state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, demonstrating the
superiority of our RoMa in the challenging PTM task.
