Abstract The registration of point cloud is essentially to 
obtain a relatively accurate coordinate transformation matrix 
through operation, and unify the point cloud data from 
multiview into the particular coordinate system through rigid 
transformations such as rotation and translation. Generally 
speaking, the registration is to discover the position conversion 
matrix of the overlap between clouds, which have an important 
effect in the domain of robot and computer vision. The purpose 
of this article is to comprehensively summarize the current 
progress of point cloud registration from two dimensions: 
algorithm optimization methods and deep learning methods. 
This paper first points out the possible application fields and 
development direction of point cloud registration in the future, 
then makes a comparison between different algorithms, and 
finally makes a proper analysis of the advantages and 
disadvantages of each algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The point clouds from multiple perspectives are registered 
as a unified perspective to form a whole scene point cloud, 
which is the registration. The essence is to transform the data 
points measured in different coordinate systems to obtain the 
overall data model. The key to the problem is how to obtain 
the corresponding rotation and translation transformation in 
order that the distance of the three-dimensional data measured 
under the two viewing angles after coordinate transformation 
is the smallest. Since the concept of quaternions was proposed 
in 1987, quaternions have become one of the most common 
representations of rotation.  
Previously, point cloud registration was only a committed 
segment in the fields related to robot [1] and computer vision 
[2]. Now its application scope has been greatly increased, 
especially in the application fields such as visualization and 
data processing. For example, 3D modeling [3], 3D mapping 
based on slam [4], thermal 3D mapping in dynamic scenes [5], 
acquisition of 3D objects [8], 3D scene reconstruction [8]
[10], 3D medical images[12],  and other applications. 
Due to the brilliance of point cloud registration in many 
fields, related research and articles are increasing year by year. 
There are lots of valuable ideas in the papers of registration in 
computer vision and related fields[2], [14].  Joaquim Salvi et 
al. [13] investigate the different techniques used for 
corresponding points and different view image registration 
before 2007 and supply a coarse to fine system framework. 
Gary K.L. Tam et al. [14] solved the registration problem of 
non-rigid objects by using the method of data fitting. François 
Pomerleau et al. [13] study different ICP based algorithms in 
the past two decades and their applications in the field of 
mobile robots. 
However, these surveys do not start from the perspective 
of traditional methods and deep learning methods, so this 
paper decided to focus on the popular point cloud registration 
algorithms in recent years. It is not only a summary of past 
studies, but also to promote the progress of point cloud 
registration in academia and even industry. This paper 
considers point cloud registration from the following two 
dimensions: algorithm optimization methods (called 
traditional method in this paper) and deep learning methods 
from the point of view of algorithm, in which the traditional 
methods are subdivided into methods based on mathematical 
optimization, feature based and ICP[16] based. Classification 
of registration algorithms as shown in Fig. 1.

these algorithms, and tries to analyze the advantages and 
disadvantages of some commonly used algorithms. Section

learning methods. Section  introduces several evaluation 
indexes to measure the registration accuracy of point clouds.

II. TRADITIONAL METHODS 
A. Methods based on mathematical optimization 
These methods mainly use mathematical tools to optimize 
the transformation matrix or propose new algorithms based on 
greedy algorithm to achieve better effect or/and lower time 
complexity. For example, the Random Sample Consensus 
(RANSAC) [17] estimates the correlation function of the 
algorithm structure from the data sets containing "external 
points" by using an iterative method. The principle of 
RANSAC is to discover the most suitable function matrix H 
to maximize the quantity of data points in the data set that meet 
the matrix, such as 
 
Where  represents the corner position of the target 
figure,  is the corner position of the scene figure, and  
is the scale parameter. An example of the algorithm is shown 
in Fig. 2. 
The advantage of RANSAC is that it has good robustness 
in estimating structure function. For instance, it can evaluate 
effective variables from a data set including numerous 
external points. However, the disadvantages of RANSAC are 
also obvious. First, function does not restrict the number of 
iterations for calculating parameters, If the algorithm limits 
the upper limit of iteration times, the final result may not be 
the optimal solution, or so far as to get the poor outcome; 
Second, The feasibility of RANSAC obtaining a believable 
architecture is directly proportional to the number of iterations. 
Moreover, RANSAC must also set relevant parameters such 
as threshold. 
 
Fig. 2. The left picture: A dataset containing many external points; The 
right picture: The line found by RANSAC (the external point does not 
affect the result) 
Florian Bernard et al. [18] studied the convex relaxation 
of quadratic optimization problems on permutation matrices 
by mathematical methods. Similarly, nadav Dym et al. [19] 
and Itay kezurer et al. [20] each proposed a new convex 
relaxation method to build the correspondence between points. 
Wolfgang Forstner et al. [21] raised and analyzed a method 
based on plane correspondence by dividing the point clouds 
into different planes and matching them in multiple point 
clouds by considering the uncertainty of a given plane. 
Someone usually solve the point cloud alignment problem 
with nonlinear rotation constraints by calculating Lagrangian 
Duality. 
Most of the existing registration algorithms obtain the 
corresponding relationship by extracting invariant descriptors, 
but they are often troubled by noise. Somebody suggested that 
a point cloud registration algorithm without correspondence 
using the randomization method. The robustness of the 
algorithm is proved by experiments. Somebody else also 
raised a robust registration method for two groups of 3D 
points even if there are a large number of outliers. A robust 
matching algorithm considering metrics is raised by J. 
Minguezjie et al.  [22]. This algorithm considers both the 
translation and rotation of the object when estimating the 
plane displacement.  
The following introduces a very commonly used algorithm, 
Normal Distribution Transformation (NDT) algorithm [23], 
which uses a unique standard optimization algorithm to 
achieve the best matching between different point clouds, The 
reason for the low time complexity of the algorithm is that it 
does not calculate the characteristics and matching of 
corresponding points between point clouds. Therefore, we can 
consider using the optimization method to make this match 
best. 
Another famous registration algorithm based on 
mathematical optimization is 4-Points Congruent Sets (4PCS) 
[24]. 4PCS uses the RANSAC algorithm framework, which 
reduces the spatial matching operation by constructing 
congruent four-point pairs with matching, and then speeds up 
the registration process. Specifically, it means to construct 
coplanar 4-point sets in the input points 
 and  with arbitrary 
posture, use affine invariance constraints to manage the 
corresponding points in this particular set, use Largest 
Common Pointset method to discover the maximum overlap 
four-point pairs after registration, get a satisfactory answer, 
and complete the point cloud rough matching. 
The spatial topology and matching schematic diagram of 
the 4PCS is shown in Fig. 3. For  and Q at any initial position, 
first make the P as the reference, and then find a long baseline 
in P that meets the requirements. As shown on the left part of 
Fig. 3, Then, the topological information of coplanar 4-point 
set  is extracted, and two scale factors  
between 4-point sets are calculated according to (2). The two 
scale factors have affine invariance when the point cloud 
rotates and translates. 
 
Calculate the four possible intersection positions of 
 according to (3), and then calculate the 
coordinates of the intersection points of all the medium and 
long baselines of 
, compare the intersection coordinates to 
determine the matching set,  means to find the 
corresponding uniform four-points, and  represents the pair 
of wide baseline points in the th and th , respectively. 
 
The congruent four-point pair of  in Fig. 3 
is , finding the coplanar 4-point sets of all 
 in the point cloud is denoted as , here 
 represents all the 4-point sets in . Repeat the above to 
gain , here  is the same as .

Fig. 3. Spatial topology and matching schematic diagram of 4PCS[24]
Most of the existing registration algorithms obtain the 
corresponding relationship by extracting invariant descriptors, 
but the 4PCS algorithm has a better performance in the face of 
registration tasks in complex scenes, so over the years, 
multifarious improved algorithms have been raised. The 
typical Super4PCS [25] algorithm adopts a unique index 
method to cut down the time complexity of 4PCS algorithm 
from to , where is the quantity of points. The 
Super4PCS is robust even in the face of large-scale scenic spot 
cloud registration. The k-4PCS [26] algorithm replaces the 
random sampling points of the 4PCS algorithm by detecting 
the key points, which solves the problem that the point cloud 
needs to be greatly downsampled in the 4PCS algorithm, and 
then realizes the point cloud matching with higher precision. 
Semantic-keypoint 4PCS [27] algorithm mainly solves the 
registration problem of urban building scene, first extracting 
the semantic key points of buildings at different levels, and 
then using semantic points to replace the random sampling 
points of the original algorithm for registration. 2PNS [28]
algorithm is an improved algorithm of Super4PCS, in this 
algorithm, the matching rule is defined by the topological 
relationship from any two points in space and the normal 
vector, which makes the algorithm particularly ideal in less 
noise environment. Experiments show that the algorithm is 5.2 
times faster in noise-free scenes, and the algorithm also has a 
good effect on scene matching with small overlap (Even if the 
overlap is only 5%, the registration can be successful). MSSF-
4PCS [29] adds normal vectors to constrain the matching links 
of coplanar 4-point sets, and speeds up the running speed of 
the algorithm by reducing the matching number of 4-point sets. 
It further optimizes the matching results of point pairs and 
optimizes the precision of registration by calculating and 
matching the point features in the neighborhood of radius of 
congruent 4-point sets. The main contribution of V4PCS [30]
is to consider volume consistency and expand coplanar to non-
coplanar, which cuts down the computational complexity and 
improves the computational efficiency. The Generalized4PCS 
[31] algorithm improved and extended the key core of the 
original algorithm, and no longer limited the points to a single 
plane. This improvement greatly optimized the efficiency of 
the algorithm. SuperGeneralized4PCS [32] algorithm is a 
combination of Super4PCS and Generalized4PCS, which 
combines intelligent indexing strategy with non-coplanar 
optimization, and also speeds up the algorithm by reducing the 
matching number of four point sets.
4PCS and its derivative algorithms are all under the 
framework of RANSAC registration, and they can quickly 
reconstruct and match similar spatial topologies in the scene. 
No matter the scene with small overlap, the scene with serious 
point noise or the scene with large range of noise can have a 
good registration effect.
B. Methods based on feature
Normal vector and curvature are the most basic geometric 
features of point cloud. Although the calculation is simple and 
fast, in most cases, the point cloud will contain many similar 
or the same eigenvalues, so that more information and 
properties cannot be obtained. Radu Bogdan Rusu et al. [33]
proposed a commonly used point cloud geometric feature 
description operator Point Feature Histogram (PFH) in 2008,
PFH is a quantification of the spatial differences in the 
neighborhood of the central point, and a histogram is obtained 
by the method of mathematical statistics to describe the 
relevant information of the adjacent central point. The purpose 
of PFH is to transform the geometric characteristics of the 
adjacent mean curvature of a point into a multi-dimensional 
histogram, which provides a very informative feature 
representation. The point cloud is not only invariant under the 
six-dimensional transformation (rotation and translation of 
each three-dimensional), but also well adapted to different 
degrees of sampling or different degrees of noise. However, 
computing FPH features is very resource-consuming, the 
computational efficiency is relatively low, and its algorithm 
complexity ( ,Where represents the quantity of 
neighborhoods of ) is difficult to meet the real-time 
requirements. Therefore, in the second year, the author 
proposed an improved version named FPFH[34], The input of 
FPFH is the same as before, and the output become a 
histogram that reflects the relevant characteristics of the 
neighborhood around each point. Different from PFH, FPFH 
mainly improves the calculation method of the neighborhood 
of the central point to speed up the calculation speed of the 
algorithm, and finally realizes the time complexity of .
Another commonly used point based feature descriptor is 
Signature of Histogram of  Orientation (SHOT) [35] proposed 
by Samuele salti et al. in 2014. Within the constructed local 
reference frame (rotation and translation invariance), the 
SHOT feature descriptor calculates the topological features of 
the neighborhood of feature points, preserves and normalizes 
the features in the histogram (robust to point cloud density and 
noise). In addition to point features, point cloud registration 
can also be based on line features. Iterative closest line (ICL) 
[36] provides a registration algorithm based on line features.
C. Methods based on ICP
There are two cases of registration, one is to find an 
approximate rotation translation matrix of the two point 
clouds without knowing the relative position, which we call 
the coarse registration. The other is to further calculate a more 
accurate rotation translation matrix when the initial value of a 
rotation translation matrix is known, which we call the fine 
registration. At present, fine registration has basically been 
fixed to use ICP algorithm and its derivative algorithms, so it 
is set as a separate module in this paper.
The core of ICP [16] employ Singular Value 
Decomposition (SVD) [37] algorithm. The basic idea is to 
give two sets of point clouds ,
, Where and represent point cloud 
coordinates, and and indicate the number of point 
clouds. Solve the rotation matrix and the shift vector that 
minimize the (4).
but the 4PCS algorithm has a better performance in the face of 
registration tasks in complex scenes, so over the years, 
multifarious improved algorithms have been raised. The 
typical Super4PCS [25] algorithm adopts a unique index 
method to cut down the time complexity of 4PCS algorithm 
, where from to , where is the quantity of points. The 
Super4PCS is robust even in the face of large-scale scenic spot 
cloud registration. The k -4PCS [26] algorithm replaces the 
random sampling points of the 4PCS algorithm by detecting 
the key points, which solves the problem that the point cloud 
needs to be greatly downsampled in the 4PCS algorithm, and 
then realizes the point cloud matching with higher precision. 
Semantic-keypoint 4PCS [27] algorithm mainly solves the 
registration problem of urban building scene, first extracting 
the semantic key points of buildings at different levels, and 
then using semantic points to replace the random sampling 
points of the original algorithm for registration. 2PNS [28]
algorithm is an improved algorithm of Super4PCS, in this 
algorithm, the matching rule is defined by the topological 
relationship from any two points in space and the normal 
vector, which makes the algorithm particularly ideal in less 
noise environment. Experiments show that the algorithm is 5.2 
times faster in noise-free scenes, and the algorithm also has a 
good effect on scene matchingwith small overlap (Even if the 
overlap is only 5%, the registration can be successful). MSSF-
4PCS [29] adds normal vectors to constrain the matching links 
of coplanar 4-point sets, and speeds up the running speed of 
the algorithm by reducing the matchingnumber of 4-point sets. 
It further optimizes the matching results of point pairs and 
optimizes the precision of registration by calculating and 
matching the point features in the neighborhood of radius of 
congruent 4-point sets. The main contribution of V4PCS [30]
is to consider volume consistency and expand coplanar to non-
coplanar, which cuts down the computational complexity and 
improves the computational efficiency. The Generalized4PCS 
[31] algorithm improved and extended the key core of the 
original algorithm, and no longer limited the points to a single 
plane. This improvement greatly optimized the efficiency of 
the algorithm . SuperGeneralized4PCS [32] algorithm is a 
combination of Super4PCS and Generalized4PCS, which 
combines intelligent indexing s trategy with non -coplanar 
optimization, and also speeds up the algorithm by reducing the 
matching number of four point sets.

The approximate flow of the algorithm is as follows: 
 Given  and , let the cloud  be the source point 
cloud and the cloud  be the target. 
 For every point in the source , find the nearest 
corresponding point  in the target , as the 
corresponding point in , to form the initial 
corresponding point. 
 Not all the corresponding relations in the initial 
corresponding point set are correct, and the wrong 
corresponding relationship will affect the final 
registration result, so the direction vector threshold is 
used to eliminate the wrong corresponding point pairs. 
 The rotation matrix  and the shift vector  are 
calculated to minimize the mean square error between 
 and . 
 Set a certain threshold  and the maximum iterations 
, act the rigid body transformation obtained in the 
previous step on the , get a new point cloud , and 
calculate the distance error between  and . if the 
error of two iterations is less than the threshold  or the 
current iterations is greater than , the iteration 
ends, otherwise the initial registration point set is 
updated to  and , and the above steps are repeated 
until the convergence conditions are met. 
However, according to [38], we know that the points in two 
point clouds cannot represent the same position in space. 
Therefore, using the distance from point to point as the error 
equation is bound to introduce random error. And If the 
difference between point clouds is large, the ICP algorithm 
has the possibility of falling into local optimization, so it 
cannot get a better matching result. The experimental effect of 
ICP is shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. 
 
 
 
Fig. 4. Experimental effect diagram of ICP The upper, middle and lower 
are ICP algorithm iterations 1, 8 and 16 times respectively 
 
Fig. 5. ICP algorithm falls into local optimal solution 
Andrew Wfitzgibbon et al.  improved the ICP algorithm by 
using the Levenberg-MarQuardt (LM) [39] algorithm, and 
then proposed the LM-ICP [40] algorithm. The LM algorithm 
can provide a numerical solution of nonlinear minimization 
(local minimization), and it has the advantages of both the 
gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton iteration. When  is 
very small, the step size is equal to the Newtonian step size, 
and when  is very large. LM algorithm is not only fast in 
optimization, but also insensitive to overparameterization, and 
can efficaciously handle the trouble of redundant parameters, 
so that the chance of the cost function obtaining the local 
minimum is greatly reduced. The experimental effect of LM-
ICP is seen in Fig. 6. 
 
Fig. 6. Experimental effect diagram of LM-ICP 
Point-to-plane ICP [41] improves the cost function on the 
basis of ICP, adds the surface normal vector of the target point, 
uses the nearest neighbor method to discover the nearest point, 
and then pulls the distance of the nearest point along the 
normal direction of the fitting plane at the target point. The 
biggest difference between point-to-line ICP [42] and the 
original ICP is that it improves the error equation. The original 
ICP takes the gap from the point to point as the error, while 
the PL-ICP uses the gap from the point to the connection 
139

between the two nearest points as the error, and PL-ICP can 
achieve second-order convergence in a short time. The 
improvement of ICP by GICP is that a Gaussian probability 
model is added to the cost function. The core idea is how to 
treat and derive the objective function of ICP algorithm from 
the point of view of probability. Although the main part of the 
algorithm is basically unchanged, the addition of Gaussian 
probability model not only ensures robustness but also reduces 
the complexity. SparseICP optimizes the algorithm by using 
sparse induced norms to achieve better registration results. 
The algorithm idea and main body flow of NICP [43] are 
basically the same as ICP. The main improvement point is to 
deal with outliers and error terms, in addition to constraining 
the distance between the corresponding points, and adding 
constraints on the normal vector and the curvature of the 
surface where the point cloud is located. Not only the distance 
from the point to the tangent plane of the corresponding point 
is considered, but also the angle difference of the normal 
vector of the corresponding point is considered. VGICP [44] 
improves ICP on real-time requirements. The reason why ICP 
is slower than NDT [23] is that ICP has a large number of kd-
tree/octree searches, while NDT correlates domains in a voxel 
way, thus avoiding numerous neighborhood searches when 
ICP is under iteration. Although the real-time performance of 
VGICP is much better than that of traditional ICP, the voxel 
method will also bring the problem of voxel mesh size 
division. I think that how to balance accuracy and running 
efficiency in practical application will be a problem to be 
solved in the future. After years of development, the derivative 
algorithm of ICP has been able to solve different problems 
from different directions, but the framework of ICP is after all 
the product of the last century. We look forward to the 
emergence of a new precise registration algorithm without 
ICP in the future. 
III. DEEP LEARNING METHODS 
As mentioned earlier, local feature descriptors of 3D 
geometric information play an important role in many fields, 
although many authors have proposed a variety of 3D feature 
descriptors in the past decade. However, it is difficult to 
generate ideal reusable and distinguishing local descriptors for 
point cloud data from diverse devices and scenes. Because in 
many cases, 3D point clouds contain more noise, or 
incomplete. 
The emergence of PPFNet is to make 3D point clouds 
generate ideal and robust 3D local feature descriptors. 
Referring to PointNet [45], this paper uses deep learning 
method to generate 3D local feature descriptors that are easy 
to distinguish and anti-rotation, and designs a new loss 
function, which can embed multiple samples of the same kind 
or different kinds into an Euclidean space at the same time, 
and the difference between samples is expressed by the 
Euclidean distance of its Eigenvectors. However, the problem 
with PPFNet is that it will take up memory twice, the effect 
will not be so ideal in some tasks, and the generalization 
ability of point cloud scenarios is not good enough. So in the 
same year, the author proposed PPF-FoldNet [46] to solve this 
problem. PPF-FoldNet made improvements on the basis of 
PPFNet, combining the encoder of PointNet and the decoder 
of FoldingNet [47]. The experimental results show that PPF-
FoldNet has excellent rotation invariance. 
In recent years, probably from 2017, The hot spot in the 
field of registration has gradually turned to solving problems 
in the way of DL, and many of them [48] [49]are not limited 
to finding 3D feature descriptors. For example, 3DFeat-Net is 
a framework that can not only detect key points, but also 
calculate key point descriptors. Under the condition of weak 
supervision, the algorithm obtains the 3D feature detector and 
descriptor through learning, and matches the point cloud. The 
biggest highlight of the algorithm is that there is no need for 
manual labeling, and the contribution of each descriptor is 
adjusted by the attention mechanism. SaraSabour et al. [50] 
raised a new architecture with a shape very much like a 
capsule, which uses iterative routing mechanism to achieve 
better experimental results than convolution networks. 
YueWang et al. [51] raised an end-to-end Deep Closest Point 
(DCP) algorithm, which uses the Transformer network 
structure to calculate a "hypothetical target point cloud". By 
using the loss function to constrain the corresponding 
relationship between known point clouds, the registration of 
point clouds is finally realized. RPM-Net [52] first realizes the 
initial value insensitivity by learning and merging a variety of 
features. Then we use the differentiable Sinkhorn algorithm 
[53] to effectively deal with the outer points of the matching 
process. At the same time, a quadratic network is used to learn 
to optimize the parameters of the annealing algorithm to get 
better execution results. The greatest contribution of RPM-Net 
is to solve the problem of sensitivity to initial rigid 
transformation and noise and outliers in point cloud rigid 
registration. PartNet is a very ingenious frame evolved from 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [54]. PartNet divides 3D 
point clouds recursively from top to bottom to form a fine-
grained hierarchy. It has achieved very good results in the 
registration at the component level. By optimizing the neural 
network (NN) model, someone raised a ordinary data-driven 
way to integrate multi-level local  geometric features, and 
made a breakthrough in the  lightweight and rotation 
invariance of the model. 
IV. E
VALUATION CRITERIA 
 At present, there is not a recognized evaluation standard 
of point cloud registration. Some methods calculate the 
distance after registration, some articles calculate the correct 
number of pairs before and after matching, and some calculate 
translation error and rotation error under different coincidence 
rates. Moreover, traditional methods and deep learning 
methods are two completely different fields, and evaluation 
methods may not necessarily communicate with each other. 
This paper briefly introduces several commonly used 
evaluation functions. 
A. Root Mean Square Error 
 
The formula is defined as shown in (5),  where  is the 
quantity of pairs of corresponding points, and  is the true 
value of Euclidean distance after registration. In the absolutely 
ideal state, after full registration, the gap between the 
corresponding points is 0, so the true value of the Euclidean 
distance also be 0. 
B. Hausdorff Distance HD  
Two point sets  and  in 
Euclidean space, HD is used to survey the distance between 
these points, as defined in (6).

where 
 
 is called bi-directional HD,  is known as the 
one-way HD from point set  to  . The corresponding 
 is known as the one-way HD from the point set  to 
. 
C. Benchmark 
For deep learning, the dataset generally chooses the 
ModelNet40 dataset in PointNet [45]. Network architecture 
this article chooses the PCRNet [67] architecture, which is 
easy to reproduce, as shown in the following Fig. 7.

There are more Loss options, such as MSE Loss, Loss 
about Euler Angle, Chamfer Distance (CD) Loss and Earth 
Mover's Distance (EMD) [55] Loss for point clouds. The main 
evaluation indexes are the isotropy of rotation angle and Euler 
angle and the running time of the algorithm. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In recent years, point cloud registration has become a 
critical technology in all fields of all walks of life, so it is a 
very valuable topic to study point cloud registration. 
This paper makes a comprehensive research on 
registration from two point of view of traditional methods and 
deep learning methods. Among them, the focus of traditional 
methods is the extraction and feature description of key points, 
and the realization method is to discover the optimal solution 
of nonlinear problems. The advantage is that it can ensure 
convergence, no training and good generalization ability for 
unknown scenes. The disadvantage is that many complex 
mathematical methods are needed to inhibit the changes of 
noise from equipment acquisition, a few outliers irrelevant to 
the object, uneven density of different parts of the same object 
and local overlap of objects that are very likely to occur, all 
these will greatly increase the computational cost and waste 
the power of calculation.. The deep learning method designs 
different network architectures and loss functions, uses deep 
learning to extract features, and then estimates the 
corresponding relationship. its advantage is that the point 
features based on deep learning can provide robust and 
accurate correspondence search, and even get a very good 
registration effect in some specific scenes. The disadvantage 
is that the interpretability of the algorithm is poor, most DL 
algorithms rely heavily on training data and have very high 
requirements for them, and the registration performance in 
unknown scenarios may be greatly degraded. 
Finally, I think there are four main aspects of Future 
developments in registration: (1) how to deal with the 
relationship between real-time and accessibility. (2) how to 
deal with the relationship between accuracy and time. (3) how 
to make the point cloud algorithm more generalized. (4) At 
present, the number of points in large-scale point clouds is 
even more than 10 million, and the existing algorithms are 
either unable to handle such large-scale data, or run very 
slowly, so how to balance the direct relationship between 
efficiency, speed and computing power will become very 
important. (5) If different input devices are used to scan, it is 
possible to obtain point clouds with different information even 
at the same location, so how to pursue more robust ways to 
solve non-homologous troubles. (6) Although DL and 
mathematical optimization methods are introduced separately 
in this paper, how to make an efficacious and perfect 
combination of the two is the light of the future.
