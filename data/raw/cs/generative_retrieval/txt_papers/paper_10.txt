ABSTRACT
Generative retrieval generates identifiers of relevant documents in
an end-to-end manner using a sequence-to-sequence architecture
for a given query. The relation between generative retrieval and
other retrieval methods, especially those based on matching within
dense retrieval models, is not yet fully comprehended. Prior work
has demonstrated that generative retrieval with atomic identifiers is
equivalent to single-vector dense retrieval. Accordingly, generative
retrieval exhibits behavior analogous to hierarchical search within
a tree index in dense retrieval when using hierarchical semantic
identifiers. However, prior work focuses solely on the retrieval
stage without considering the deep interactions within the decoder
of generative retrieval.
In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that generative
retrieval and multi-vector dense retrieval share the same framework
for measuring the relevance to a query of a document. Specifically,
we examine the attention layer and prediction head of generative
retrieval, revealing that generative retrieval can be understood
as a special case of multi-vector dense retrieval. Both methods
compute relevance as a sum of products of query and document
vectors and an alignment matrix. We then explore how generative
retrieval applies this framework, employing distinct strategies for
computing document token vectors and the alignment matrix. We
have conducted experiments to verify our conclusions and show
that both paradigms exhibit commonalities of term matching in
their alignment matrix.

Our finding applies to many generative retrieval identifier de-
signs and provides possible explanations on how generative re-
trieval can express query-document relevance. As multi-vector
dense retrieval is the state-of-the-art dense retrieval method cur-
rently, understanding the connection between generative retrieval
and multi-vector dense retrieval is crucial for shedding light on the
underlying mechanisms of generative retrieval and for developing,
and understanding the potential of, new retrieval models.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the advent of pre-trained language models has
catalyzed the popularity of neural-based retrieval models within
the information retrieval community [14, 15, 31, 34, 41].
Neural-based retrieval models. Dense retrieval (DR), as one of
the effective neural-based retrieval methods, has achieved the state-
of-the-art ranking performance on multiple benchmarks [14, 15, 31].
Several approaches have been proposed to use multiple vectors to
represent documents or queries, a.k.a., multi-vector dense retrieval
(MVDR) [15, 34, 51].
Recently, generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a new par-
adigm in information retrieval. It aims to generate identifiers of
relevant documents for a given query directly and parametrizes the
indexing, retrieval, and ranking process in dense retrieval systems

into a single model. GR adopts a sequence-to-sequence architec-
ture model and is trained to directly map queries to their relevant
document identifiers.
Generative retrieval vs. dense retrieval. Dense retrieval models
typically employ encoders, e.g., BERT [6], for encoding both queries
and documents, while the generative retrieval model adopts an en-
coder for query encoding and a decoder for identifier generation.
Despite their superficial differences, dense retrieval and generative
retrieval share key characteristics in their query-document rele-
vance computations. When the two methods use document identi-
fiers such as sub-strings, titles, or semantic IDs as representations
for documents, relevance to a query of a document is computed as
the dot product of two vectors in both methods. Dense retrieval in-
volves using the direct product of the query vectors and document
vectors as the relevance, while generative retrieval leverages the
product of the last latent state from the decoder at each position
with the prediction head, a.k.a., the word embedding lookup table.
Consequently, a natural question that arises in this context:
How is generative retrieval related to dense retrieval?
Although GR has shown promising results in various benchmarks
as a new end-to-end retrieval paradigm [ 19, 25, 38, 42, 44], rel-
atively few publications have closely examined how GR models
work. Nguyen and Yates[29] have shown thatGR using atomic iden-
tifiers can be viewed as a variant of bi-encoders for dense retrieval
because the word embedding lookup table in generative retrieval
works exactly the same as the flat index in dense retrieval. Thus,
we can partially respond to the above question thatGR with atomic
identifiers is single-vector dense retrieval. Although atomic identi-
fiers are considered non-mainstream in GR, it offers an insightful
perspective on the matter. Nguyen and Yates [29] also discuss that
GR with hierarchical semantic identifiers exhibits behavior similar
to hierarchical search within a tree index in dense retrieval. How-
ever, their discussion focuses only on the retrieval stage without
rigorously considering deep interactions within the decoder.
Generative retrieval as multi-vector dense retrieval. In this
work, we connect generative retrieval to a state-of-the-art dense
retrieval method, multi-vector dense retrieval, in a rigorous way.
We illustrate that these two methods exhibit commonalities in their
training targets and a shared focus on semantic matching . We first
examine the attention layer and the prediction head of GR and
show that the logits in the loss function can be reformulated to
a product of document word embeddings, query token vectors,
and attention matrix in Section 4. This corresponds to the unified
MVDR framework introduced in [18, 34]. In Section 5 we explore the
distinct document encoding and alignment strategy in GR. Specif-
ically, our discussion includes (i) its simple document encoding
and how prefix-aware weight-adaptive (PAWA) decoding [42] and
non-parametric (NP)-decoding [17] apply to our framework (Sec-
tion 5.1), and (ii) the distinct alignment strategy employed by GR
compared to MVDR and its properties (Section 5.2).
Our discovery provides reliable explanations of how GR can ex-
press query-document relevance. By explaining how theGR method
models the query-document relevance, we can further understand
how GR is fundamentally different from dense retrieval methods
and adds to the spectrum of neural-based retrieval models. The
connection we present provides the variants of GR methods with a
theoretical foundation for further improvement.
Contributions. Our main contributions in this paper are:
(1) We offer new insights intoGR from the perspective of MVDR
by showing that these methods share the same framework for
measuring query-document relevance.
(2) We explore how GR applies this framework, employing distinct
strategies for document encoding and the alignment matrix.
(3) We also conduct extensive analytical experiments based on the
framework to verify our conclusions and illustrate the term-
matching phenomenon and properties of different alignment
directions in both paradigms.
2 RELATED WORK
Multi-vector dense retrieval (MVDR) can be seen as a generaliza-
tion of single-vector dual encoder models [14, 15]. Instead of encod-
ing the complete content of both query and documents into a single
low-dimensional vector, MVDR uses fine-grained token-level mod-
eling for scoring. ExistingMVDR models such as ColBERT [15] com-
pute query-document relevance by selecting the highest-scoring
document token for each query token and aggregating the scores.
The postponed token-level interactions allow us to efficiently apply
the model for retrieval, benefiting the effectiveness of modeling
fine-grained interactions. MVDR overcomes the limited expressiv-
ity of single-vector retrieval and achieves significantly better results
across various benchmarks [14, 15, 18, 24, 31, 34]. However, due to
the cost of storing vectors for each document token, it is challenging
to scale the approach to large collections [10, 15, 18, 34].
Generative retrieval (GR) is an emerging paradigm in informa-
tion retrieval [19, 33, 36, 41, 42, 47]. It leverages generative models to
directly generate identifiers of relevant documents. This approach
originated with [2, 41] and has garnered considerable attention [see,
e.g., 40]. Currently, all implementations of the generative retrieval
paradigm adhere to an encoder-decoder transformer architecture,
e.g., T5 [ 35] and BART [ 20]. In this method, documents are ini-
tially associated with a concise token sequence that serves as an
identifier. The model is then trained to predict this token sequence
autoregressively, using conventional cross-entropy loss.
One notable advantage of the generative retrieval model is its
streamlined end-to-end architecture, which requires significantly
less disk storage space compared to other retrieval methods. How-
ever, it is important to note that due to the limited supervision of
each token, the generative retrieval may not achieve comparable
performance when compared to dense retrieval [33, 46].
Connecting dense retrieval and generative retrieval. Nguyen
and Yates [29] show that GR with atomic identifiers is equivalent
to single-vector dense retrieval. They compare the inferential pro-
cesses of DR with a tree index and GR with hierarchical identifiers.
However, the former is just an optimized version of the originalDR
without changing the semantic matching method, while the latter
also considers the predicted IDs and the query in each generation
step, which greatly affects how GR would express the relevance,
but this is ignored in [29]. Yuan et al. [46] empirically analyze the
error rate at each generation step ofGR and identify the problem of
poor memory accuracy for fine-grained features compared withDR.
Generative Retrieval as Multi-Vector Dense Retrieval SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA.
They straightforwardly integrated GR and DR into a new coarse-to-
fine retrieval paradigm, combining their respective strengths, but
circumvented an in-depth discussion of the connection between
them.
In this work, we address the limitations listed above by showing
that GR expresses query-document relevance in the same way as
MVDR. This connection is rigorously derived from the decoder of
GR and can be applied to many identifiers.
3 PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we formulate our task and introduce key notation
and the mainstream framework of MVDR models.
Task definition.We formulate the retrieval task as ranking by rele-
vance score. Given a query𝑞, we aim to retrieve relevant documents
𝑑 in D by ranking them by their relevance rel(𝑑, 𝑞) to 𝑞.
Notations. Table 1 lists the main notation used in the paper. We
denote the word embedding lookup table in the decoder as 𝐸 and
the vocabulary set as V. Each document 𝑑 comprises 𝑀 tokens. To
ensure uniform length, padding tokens are added or excess tokens
are truncated from each document. The word embedding matrix
of 𝑑 is denoted as 𝐸𝑑 B [𝑒𝑑1, . . . , 𝑒𝑑𝑀 ] ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑀, and the latent
token vector matrix after encoding is 𝐷 B [𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑀 ] ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑀.
Each query 𝑞 with 𝑁 tokens has token vectors 𝑄 B [𝑞1, . . . , 𝑞𝑁 ] ∈
R𝑑 ×𝑁 after encoding, similar to the documents.
Table 1: Main notation used in this work.
Symbol Description
𝐸 word embedding lookup table
𝐸𝑑 document word embedding matrix
𝐷, 𝑄 document / query token vector matrix
𝑑𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 document / query tokens
𝑑𝑖, 𝑞𝑗 encoded document / query token vector
Framework for MVDR. Following [18, 34], MVDR methods can
be represented as a unified framework, in which the relevance
between query 𝑞 and document 𝑑 is given by:
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) = 1
𝑍 sum(𝐷⊤𝑄 ⊙ 𝐴) = 1
𝑍
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗
𝑑⊤
𝑖 𝑞𝑗 𝐴𝑖 𝑗, (1)
where 𝐴 is the alignment matrix that controls whether a document
and query token pair can be matched and contribute to the rele-
vance, and 𝑍 = Í
𝑖 𝑗 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 is used for normalization and is dropped in
many MVDR methods.
Alignment strategy.Different MVDR models adopt different align-
ment strategies, and, thus, a different alignment matrix 𝐴. It is
often computed using heuristic algorithms, such as lexical exact
match [12], top-1 relevant token match [15], single-vector align-
ment [14, 26], or sparse unary salience [34].
Contrastive loss used in MVDR. MVDR methods usually use
contrastive loss as the training target, where negative documents
are used. For a query 𝑞 and target document 𝑑, the loss is computed
as
L (𝑑, 𝑞) = − log exp rel(𝑑, 𝑞)Í
𝑑 − ∈ D− exp rel(𝑑 −, 𝑞) , (2)
where D − is the collected negative set.
4 IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF GENERATIVE
RETRIEV AL
To address the question posed in Section 1, this section conducts a
detailed analysis of GR. Specifically, we first illustrate the model
architecture and training loss of the GR (Section 4.1). Subsequently,
we derive that the training target of GR falls into the framework of
MVDR (Section 4.2):
L (𝑑, 𝑞) ∝ sum

˜𝐸⊤
𝑑 𝑄 ⊙ 𝐴

, (3)
where ˜𝐸𝑑, 𝑄 and 𝐴 correspond to 𝐷, 𝑄 and 𝐴 in Eq. (1).
4.1 Model architecture and training loss
Model architecture. We focus on the transformer sequence-to-
sequence architecture utilized in GR, more precisely, the encoder-
decoder structure. Within this framework, the encoder primarily
targets processing the input query, while the decoder is tasked with
predicting document identifiers.
The decoder component consists of stacks of self-attention, cross-
attention, and feed-forward layers. We particularly underscore the
significance of the cross-attention layers, as they facilitate interac-
tion between query tokens and document tokens.
To predict the document token𝑑𝑖 at the𝑖-th position, we compute
the cross attention weights between query token vectors 𝑄 and
ˆ𝑑𝑖 −1 from the previous attention layers at position(𝑖 −1) as follows:
𝛼𝑖 = softmax(𝑄⊤𝑊 ˆ𝑑𝑖 −1), (4)
where softmax(·) denotes the column-wise softmax function, 𝑊 ∈
R𝑑 ×𝑑 is the product of the attention matrices 𝑊𝐾 and 𝑊𝑄, i.e.,
𝑊 = 𝑊 ⊤
𝐾 𝑊𝑄, and 𝛼𝑖 ∈ R𝑁 .
Consequently, the output of the cross-attention layer is
ℎ𝑖 = 𝑊𝑉 𝑄𝛼𝑖 ∈ R𝑑 . (5)
For simplicity, we ignore the non-linear activation functions, and
the linear maps in the feedforward layers can be absorbed in atten-
tion weights, e.g., 𝑊𝑉 . Therefore, ℎ𝑖 serves as the prediction head
for generating the next token.
Training loss. The loss function to minimize at position 𝑖 is for-
mulated as:
L𝑖 (𝑑, 𝑞) = − log
 exp 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖
Í
𝑣 ∈ V exp 𝑒⊤𝑣 ℎ𝑖
!
(6)
= −𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 + log
∑︁
𝑣 ∈ V
exp 𝑒⊤
𝑣 ℎ𝑖 . (7)
4.2 GR has the same framework as MVDR
Next, we demonstrate that GR shares a similar framework with
MVDR, namely, that the logits within the loss function can be
reformulated as a product of document word embeddings, query
token vectors, and attention matrix. This formulation corresponds
to Eq. (1).
In particular, as we employ teacher-forcing supervision, ground-
truth document identifiers are directly fed into the decoder, and
token vectors at all positions are computed simultaneously. Based

on this configuration, the overall loss is given by:
L (𝑑, 𝑞) =
∑︁
𝑖 ∈ [𝑀 ]
log 𝑝 (𝑑𝑖 | 𝑑𝑖 −1, . . . , 𝑑0, 𝑞) (8)
=
∑︁

ℎ𝑖 + log
∑︁
𝑣 ∈ V
exp 𝑒⊤
𝑣 ℎ𝑖
!
, (10)
where 𝑑0 could be some special token such as [BOS] or the [CLS]
token vector from the query.
When utilizing the sampled softmax loss, which involves em-
ploying several negative tokens instead of the entire set of tokens
in the lookup embedding table, the loss exhibits a similar structure
to the contrastive loss used in DR and MVDR. Consequently, we
treat the dot product of embedding 𝑒𝑑𝑖 and token vector ℎ𝑖, i.e.,
𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖, as the final relevance score at position 𝑖. Further insights
into the reason are elaborated in Appendix A. We plug in the dot
product with the computing of ℎ𝑖 from Eq. (5) and obtain:
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) =
∑︁
𝑖 ∈ [𝑀 ]

In conclusion, we observe a similar framework from GR to
MVDR, rel(𝑑, 𝑞) = sum( ˜𝐸⊤
𝑑 𝑄 ⊙ 𝐴), where the relevance is repre-
sented by an interaction of multiple “token vectors, ” i.e., ˜𝐸𝑑 and
𝑄, from both query and document and aligned by a matrix 𝐴. We
summarize our derivation and conclusion in Figure 1.
5 COMPARISON BETWEEN MVDR AND GR
To further explore how GR is related to MVDR, we build upon the
unified framework of relevance computation for GR and MVDR
derived in the previous section. We conduct a comprehensive anal-
ysis of both methods, focusing specifically on their similarities and
disparities in terms of the document encoding and the design of
the alignment matrix. A summary of the comparison between the
two methods is shown in Table 2.

5.1 Document encoding
One of the noticeable differences between GR and MVDR is in
the document encoding. As depicted in Figure 1, MVDR utilizes
more expressive contextualized token vectors 𝐷 = [𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑀 ]
for each position. In contrast, GR only attends each query token to
a simple word embedding 𝑒𝑑𝑖 that does not hold any contextual
information about the document. This was considered a severe
compromise for the extremely lightweight modeling and storage
of GR. To address this imbalance in modeling capacity, several
studies [17, 42] have proposed novel decoding methods. Wang et al.
[42] introduce the prefix-aware weight-adaptive (PAWA) decoding
method, while Lee et al . [17] propose the non-parametric ( NP)
decoding. We incorporate these methods into our framework and
show how they fundamentally improve the encoding compared
with MVDR in Table 3.
Table 3: Document encoding comparison between GR and
MVDR. PA W Aand NP-decoding either multiply or replace
the simple embedding vectors ˜𝐸𝑑 with contextualized token
vectors ˜𝐷.

Generative Retrieval as Multi-Vector Dense Retrieval SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA.
PA W Aenhances the document encoding from ˜𝐸𝑑 to ˜𝐸𝑑 ˜𝐷′.
PAWA[42] aims to improve the embedding modeling for distin-
guishing different semantics of a token ID at different positions.
Unlike the standard transformer, which uses a static embedding
lookup table for every position, PAWAgenerates different embed-
ding tables at each generation step.PAWAconsists of a transformer
decoder and an adaptive projection layer E ∈ R𝑀 × | V | ×𝑑 ×𝑑. The
projection matrix of token 𝑣 at the 𝑖-th position is
𝐸𝑖,𝑣 = E[𝑖, 𝑣, :, :] ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑑 .
Here, E can be seen as a generalized version of the embedding
lookup table that uses a matrix 𝐸𝑖,𝑣 to represent each token 𝑣. To
get the generated embedding vector for token 𝑣 at the 𝑖-th position,
PAWAdecoder first uses the transformer decoder to process the
document into a set of latent vectors 𝐷′ = [𝑑′
1, . . . , 𝑑′
𝑀 ] ∈ R𝑑 ×𝑀.
Then it multiplies the projection matrix 𝐸𝑖,𝑣 with the latent vector
𝑑′
𝑖 and gets the final embedding vector 𝑒𝑖,𝑣 = 𝐸𝑖,𝑣 𝑑′
𝑖 .
Therefore, we have the logit 𝑒⊤𝑣 ℎ𝑖 in loss Eq. (10) replaced by

With a similar derivation as in Section 4.2, the relevance can be

and ˜𝐸𝑑 = 𝑊 ⊤
𝑉 [𝐸1,𝑑1, . . . , 𝐸𝑀,𝑑𝑀 ] ∈ R𝑑 × (𝑑 ×𝑀 ).
As we can see, PAWAmultiplies the term ˜𝐸⊤
𝑑 𝑄 with contex-
tualized document token vectors ˜𝐷′, which greatly improves the
expressivity of document encoding.
NP-decoding directly replaces ˜𝐸𝑑 with 𝐷. Lee et al. [17] em-
ploy an approach akin to contextualized sparse retrieval methods,
leveraging token vectors encoded by the Contextualized Embed-
ding Encoder [CE Encoder, 17], referred to as contextualized token
embeddings. This set of vectors, denoted as 𝐷 in our notation,
serves as the embedding table for the decoder. Both the Base and
Async nonparametric decoding methods in [17] can be reformu-
lated within our framework as:
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) = sum(𝐷⊤𝑄 ⊙ 𝐴), (20)
where 𝐷 is the token vectors of documents either pre-computed (as
done by the pre-trained T5 model and frozen in the Base method)
or gradually updated (by the encoder of the GR model every 𝑁
epochs in the Async method) during the training of the GR model.
While the NP-decoding method shares the same document en-
coding with MVDR, two significant differences exist:
(1) In NP-decoding, 𝐷 is mostly frozen and detached from training,
causing training imbalance compared to MVDR. 𝑄 and 𝐴 in
NP-decoding are fully trained, while 𝐷 remains frozen.
(2) Due to GR computing logits for the entire vocabulary in each
generation step, there’s a need to reduce the large storage foot-
print of 𝐷 to save computation. NP-decoding methods address
this by using clustering to compress token vectors. MVDR, on
the other side, achieves lower inference time through a sparse
alignment strategy.
5.2 Alignment strategy
In addition to document encoding, the alignment matrix represents
a crucial distinction between GR and MVDR methods. This matrix
plays a decisive role in shaping the divergent inference procedures
employed in retrieval. In this section, we analyze the alignment
matrix, denoted as 𝐴 within our unified framework, in terms of
sparsity, alignment direction, and some common properties.
5.2.1 The concept of “alignment” in both methods. The concept
of “alignment” has garnered significant attention inMVDR [9, 18,
23, 34]. We will briefly introduce the alignment problem in MVDR
models, and claim that the alignment matrix of the GR method, as
asserted in our framework Eq. (16), indeed exhibits similar align-
ment functionality to MVDR models.
Token alignment involves determining whether tokens from the
query and document should be matched lexically or semantically. It
essentially represents another formulation of the “term mismatch
problem” [10, 15, 34, 50]. The prevailing strategy considered op-
timal at present is the all-to-all soft alignment strategy in MVDR
models [15, 34], which eliminates the lexical form match restriction.
GR methods leverage the transformer architecture that origi-
nated in NLP, and the concept of “alignment” has been extensively
discussed in the domain of neural machine translation [3, 5, 21, 22],
focusing on the alignment between tokens in source and target
sentences. The attention mechanism, as a core component, com-
putes the alignment matrix and proves highly effective in capturing
alignment between source and target sentences [5, 13, 45, 48]. The-
oretical works [8, 32] have further validated the phenomenon of
copying behavior, forming a foundational basis for the alignment
ability.
We conclude that, in GR methods, the attention matrix is able to
capture the alignment between the query and the document, akin
to the alignment matrix observed in MVDR methods.
5.2.2 Different sparsity and learnability: sparse vs. dense and learned
alignment matrices. The alignment matrices ofMVDR and GR differ
in sparsity and learnability.MVDR typically employs a sparse align-
ment matrix for maximum efficiency during inference. In contrast,
GR utilizes a dense and fully learnable alignment matrix derived
from the computationally intensive attention mechanism.
For MVDR methods, the sparse alignment matrix is often com-
puted using heuristic algorithms [12, 15, 34]. Taking ColBERT [15]
as an example, it selects the most relevant document token for each
query token. The relevance score between document 𝑑 and query

element for each column ( 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 if 𝑑⊤
𝑖 𝑞𝑗 = max𝑖 ∈ [𝑀 ] 𝑑⊤
𝑖 𝑞𝑗 ;
𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0 otherwise). The sum-max operation is highly parallelizable,
ensuring efficiency during inference.
For GR methods, the alignment matrix is computed through
the attention mechanism, considering all possible pairs of query
and document tokens, as shown in Eq. (16).
The dense alignment matrix is highly expressive and trainable.
While not suitable for exact relevance score computation in in-
ference for each query-document pair, efficient approximate al-
gorithms such as greedy search or beam search can be used to
retrieve the top-𝑘 documents. These decoding algorithms rely on
the following decomposition:
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) =
∑︁
𝑖 ∈ [𝑀 ]
sum

˜𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
𝑄𝛼𝑖

=
∑︁
𝑖 ∈ [𝑀 ]
rel(𝑑𝑖, 𝑞), (22)
where rel(𝑑𝑖, 𝑞) is conditioned on 𝑑0, . . . , 𝑑𝑖 −1, approximating the
search for the most relevant document𝑑 to finding the most relevant
token 𝑑𝑖 at each position 𝑖.
5.2.3 Different alignment directions: query-to-document vs. docu-
ment-to-query alignment. Beyond differences in the sparsity and
learnability of the alignment matrix, MVDR and GR exhibit distinc-
tions in their alignment directions.
Eq. (21) reveals that MVDR’s relevance score can be decomposed
into the sum of relevance scores for each query token and its aligned
document token. In this context, we consider the alignment matrix
in MVDR as query-to-document alignment. Each query token
individually aligns to a document token, seeking the optimal match
during retrieval. Mathematically, the alignment matrix is computed
column-wise and represents a one-hot vector for each column.
Conversely, the relevance score of GR, as depicted in Eq. (22), is
the sum of relevance scores for each document token and its softly
aligned query token. Here, we categorize the alignment matrix in
GR as document-to-query alignment. Each document token is
considered individually to focus attention on the most relevant
query token. The alignment matrix is computed row-wise with a
softmax(·) operation to normalize attention weights in each row.
Document-to-query alignment may seem counter-intuitive for
a retrieval task, as we do not know the target documents while
predicting. As a solution, GR pre-computes the alignment strategy
for the document token𝑑𝑖 (to be predicted) usingprevious document
tokens 𝑑0, . . . , 𝑑𝑖 −1 and thus can retrieve the next token that best
aligns with the desired next alignment strategy.
5.2.4 Low-rank nature of both alignment matrices. In analyzing the
shared characteristics of the two alignment matrices, it is demon-
strated that both matrices exhibit a low-rank property.
MVDR model, e.g., AligneR [34], integrates the pairwise align-
ment matrix with unary salience, given by
𝐴 = ˜𝐴 ⊙ 𝑢𝑑 𝑢⊤
𝑞 . (23)
Here, ˜𝐴 ∈ R𝑀 ×𝑁 signifies the pairwise alignment matrix, deter-
mining the alignment of query and document tokens. The sparse
token weights, 𝑢𝑑 ∈ R𝑀 and 𝑢𝑞 ∈ R𝑁 , decide whether a token
requires alignment. Notably, the alignment matrix 𝐴 contains a
low-rank component 𝑢𝑑 𝑢⊤𝑞 that influences the alignment strategy.
In the case of GR methods, the alignment matrix is computed
using an attention mechanism, which inherently results in a low-
rank matrix. A lemma provides evidence of this low-rank property
and is presented briefly here, with a detailed proof in Appendix B.
Lemma 5.1. For a matrix 𝐴 = softmax  𝐷⊤𝑊 𝑄, there exists a
rank-one matrix 𝑅 such that
∥𝐴 − 𝑅∥ ≤ 4𝛾 ∥𝑊 ∥, (24)
where the term 𝛾 depends on the matrix entries.
From this lemma, we can conclude that both MVDR and GR meth-
ods reveal a rank-one component in their alignment matrices.
5.2.5 Decomposition of both relevance scores. In this subsection, we
show that the relevance score computation in both MVDR and GR
models can be decomposed into query and document components.
The MVDR method employs a bi-encoder architecture, wherein
query and document tokens are modeled separately. This architec-
ture can easily be regarded as a decomposition of the relevance
score between the query and document:
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) = sum  𝐷⊤𝑄 ⊙ 𝐴 = sum  top-1(𝐷⊤𝑄) ,
where top-1(·) is the operator that selects the maximum value in
each column of the matrix.
In the subsequent lemma, we establish that the relevance score
of GR cannot only be decomposed but also be kernelized, implying
the existence of a kernel function capable of processing both query
vectors and document vectors to compute the score (further details
can be found in Appendix C):
Lemma 5.2. For simplicity, let rel(𝑑, 𝑞) = sum(𝐷⊤𝑄 ⊙ 𝐴), where
𝐴 = softmax(𝐷⊤𝑄). It can be kernelized as
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) =
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗
𝑑⊤
𝑖 𝑞𝑗 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 =
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗
𝑑⊤
𝑖 𝑞𝑗 softmax  𝑑⊤
𝑖 𝑄
𝑗
=
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗
1
𝑝𝑖 𝑗
tr  𝐹 (𝑑𝑖 )⊤𝐹 (𝑞𝑗 ) , (25)
where 𝐹 (𝑥) = 𝑥𝜑(𝑥)⊤, and 𝑝𝑖 𝑗 is a term that depends on 𝑑𝑖 and
𝑞𝑗 . We choose elu(·) as the kernel function 𝜑(·).
Furthermore, by applying the trace inequality, we can approxi-
mately decompose the relevance score as
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) ≤
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗
1
ˆ𝑝𝑖 ˆ𝑝 𝑗
√︁
tr (𝐹 (𝑑𝑖 )⊤𝐹 (𝑑𝑖 ))
√︃
tr  𝐹 (𝑞𝑗 )⊤𝐹 (𝑞𝑗 ).
From this lemma, we can conclude that both relevance scores in
MVDR and GR methods can be decomposed. The decomposition
of MVDR is more straightforward, and the kernelization of GR is
more complicated. Both kernelizations would provide possibilities
for new retrieval strategies.

5.3 Upshot
In summary, our findings indicate that certain studies enhance
the modeling capacity of GR by employing more expressive docu-
ment encoding, akin to MVDR. Furthermore, GR employs a distinct
alignment direction, but it also exhibits similar low-rank and de-
composition properties with MVDR.
6 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Next, we seek experimental confirmation that generative retrieval
and multi-vector dense retrieval share the same framework for mea-
suring relevance to a query of a document, as derived in Section 4.
6.1 Datasets
We conduct experiments on two well-known datasets, NQ [16] and
MS MARCO [28]. We use the same settings and processed datasets
as Sun et al. [38], and we summarize the statistics of the datasets
in Table 4.
Table 4: Statistics of datasets used in our experiments.
Dataset # Docs # Test queries # Train pairs
NQ320K 109,739 7,830 307,373
MS MARCO 323,569 5,187 366,235
NQ320k. NQ320K is a popular dataset for evaluating retrieval
models [14, 25, 41, 42]. It is based on the Natural Questions (NQ)
dataset [16]. NQ320k consists of 320k query-document pairs, where
the documents are gathered from Wikipedia pages, and the queries
are natural language questions.
MS MARCO. MS MARCO document retrieval dataset is a collection
of queries and web pages from Bing searches. Like NQ320k and
following [38], we sample a subset of documents from the labeled
documents and use their corresponding queries for training. We
evaluate the models on the queries of the MS MARCO dev set and
retrieval on the sampled document subset.
6.2 Base models
As we aim to provide a new perspective on GR as MVDR, we con-
sider representative models from both paradigms, i.e., SEAL [1] for
GR and ColBERT [15] for MVDR. For a fair comparison, we repro-
duce both methods using the T5 architecture [35]. We have made
several changes to adapt ColBERT and SEAL to their T5 variants:1
• T5-ColBERT. We use in-batch negative samples instead of the
pair-wise samples in the official ColBERTv1 implementation. We
set the batch size to 256 and train 5 epochs. The details of our T5
variant ColBERT are in Appendix D.
• T5-SEAL. We use the Huggingface transformers library [43] to
train the model. We use the constructed query-to-span data for
training and each span has a length of 10 sampled according to
Bevilacqua et al. [1]. The learning rate is set to 1e-3 and the batch
size is 256.

6.3 Inference settings
We consider two inference settings: end-to-end and reranking.
End-to-end retrieval setting. Both methods can perform an end-
to-end retrieval on the corpus for a given query.
• T5-ColBERT maintains a large vector pool of all document token
vectors after training. During inference, it first retrieves for each
query token vector, the 𝑘-nearest document token vectors in the
vector pool, resulting in 𝑁 × 𝑘 retrieved vectors. These vectors
are from at most 𝑁 × 𝑘 different documents which are used as
candidates. It then computes the exact relevance score for each
candidate document and performs the final rerank.
• T5-SEAL directly uses its generative style inference with the help
of constrained beam search to predict valid document identifiers,
i.e., n-grams from the documents.
Rerank setting. Since we are focusing on relevance computing
in the training target, we introduce a rerank setting that removes
the influence of different approximated inference strategies. As
stated in some previous work [18, 25], both MVDR and GR have
discrepancies between training and inference. The approximated
retrieval methods are largely different from the training target
and may decrease the performance of the trained retrievers. In the
rerank setting, we collect 100 documents retrieved by BM25 [37]
together with the ground-truth document as the candidate set for
each query. As in the training stage, we take both the query and
each candidate document as the input of the model and use the
relevance computing in Section 3 and 4.
7 EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES
7.1 Performance of different alignment
directions
As described in Section 5.2.3, MVDR and GR exhibit different align-
ment directions, i.e., query-to-document and document-to-query
alignment. We aim to look at how alignment directions affect re-
trieval performance. We first conduct experiments in the rerank
setting to show the performance gap between MVDR and GR. As
shown in Table 5, MVDR with the original alignment strategy,
which is indicated as MVDR (q→d), has a much better performance
than GR. To compare the alignment directions of MVDR and GR,
we have designed a model MVDR (q←d) that integrates the fea-
tures of both, i.e., expressive document encoding from MVDR and
document-to-query alignment strategy from GR. From Table 5, we
can see that the performance of the new model is roughly interme-
diate between the other two. Note that the designed experimental
model MVDR (q←d) can only be used in a rerank setting. We con-
clude that query-to-document alignment is preferred for reranking.

7.2 Term matching in alignment
As we have discussed in Section 5.2.1, alignment is essentially a
term-matching problem. In this section, we design an experiment
to observe the extent of term matching in the two methods, and we
find both methods exhibit a preference for exact term matching in
their alignment.
Exact match of MVDR in query-to-document direction. We
calculate the exact matching rate between document token IDs and
each query token ID during the alignment process, which we refer
to as the “hard exact match rate. ” We also define a “soft exact match
rate” which is the alignment score corresponding to the exact match
query-document token pairs. The alignment score is defined as the
element in the alignment matrix. As MVDR uses a sparse align-
ment matrix, we apply column-wise softmax(·) to 𝐴 and use the
element as the alignment score. We average the rate over candidate
documents for each query token and categorize the query tokens
according to their IDF. We assume that IDF approximates the term
importance as is done in [11]. From the result in Figure 2, we can
see that MVDR chooses exactly matched document tokens in 11.4%
on average. Also, we notice that rare query tokens have not re-
ceived much attention during alignment. This observation suggests
that MVDR may prioritize commonly occurring query tokens in its
alignment process, potentially overlooking or underemphasizing
the importance of rare query tokens.
Exact match of MVDR and GR in document-to-query direc-
tion. We have devised an experiment to investigate the alignment
in the opposite direction, i.e., document-to-query, in Figure 3. As
GR is not trained with hard alignment, we only examine the soft
exact match rate of both methods. The computation of the exact
match rate is similar except that it is computed for each document
token. From the results, we have discerned a consistent trend: as
the importance of tokens increases, the rate of exact matches also
tends to rise. We think this is because it is hard for the rare query
token to match among many common tokens since the document
is much longer than the query. When we look at each document
token, it will be easier to match among fewer query tokens. We
also conduct experiments on MS MARCO and have similar results.

7.3 Improved document encoding
In Section 5.1, we include two popular document encoding methods,
PAWA and NP-decoding, into our framework. To demonstrate the
improvement of these two methods, we compare the performance
of GR with and without them in Table 6. PAWAis typically used in
GR with short semantic identifiers due to its high computational
complexity during generation. Thus, we compare it with DSI [41]

with semantic identifiers. Note that all these models use the same
architecture (T5-base [35]) and similar training procedures without
data augmentation, e.g., synthetic query-doc pairs generation, etc.
*-PAWAand *-NP can be seen as a naive approach to using the two
enhancing methods to the base GR models. From Table 6, we see
that both PAWAand NP-decoding can greatly improve the perfor-
mance and achieve similar results compared with T5-ColBERT on
Recall@1. However, there is still a large gap in terms of Recall@10.
The implementation of the additional decoding modules is only
an approximation for reducing the cost of time and storage as dis-
cussed in Section 5.1. This, together with the alignment direction,
may be a cause of the performance gap between GR equipped with
these document encodings and MVDR.

encoding methods on NQ320k in end-to-end setting. The
results of DSI-PA W A, DSI, and T5-GENRE-NP are from [17, 38,

7.4 Low-rank nature of alignment matrix
In Section 5.2.4, we show that the alignment matrix in GR also has
a low-rank property in Lemma 5.1. As MVDR using alignment ma-
trix (23) already contains a low-rank component, we only conduct
experiments to verify GR. Since the𝛾 in Lemma 5.1 is hard to attain,
we illustrate the relation between ∥𝑊 ∥ and ∥𝐴 − 𝑅∥ in Figure 4(a).
We can see that the inequality is loose and ∥𝐴 − 𝑅∥ is much lower
than ∥𝑊 ∥. We also show the relative error of the approximation
of 𝑅 in Figure 4(b). The error is relatively low on average, which
indicates the low-rank nature of the alignment matrix of GR.
7.5 Case study of the alignment matrix
We chose a specific case from the dataset NQ320k to show what
the alignment matrix looks like in Figure 5. Since the document is
too long for demonstration, we simplify and extract a sub-sentence
containing the answer to the query. In Figure 5(a), we have observed
a pronounced phenomenon of exact matches in MVDR. The song
name and people’s names are completely matched with high scores.

 (b) GR query-to-document direction
Figure 5: An example of alignment matrix in MVDR and GR.
In Figure 5(b), this phenomenon is less obvious, but each document
token has more attention on the people’s name and song name.
7.6 Upshot
We verify the existence of “exact term match, ” a specific alignment
scenario, in both paradigms. We also show the superiority of the
alignment direction in MVDR. The improved document encoding
and the low-rank nature of the alignment matrix are validated.
8 LIMITATIONS
We have examined the training target of GR and have connected it
with MVDR, but we have not discussed whether relevance comput-
ing can be generalized to the generative style inference. We have
not considered the multi-layer interactions in the cross-attention
between query and document for simplicity.
Our framework does not discuss how query-generation augmen-
tation reduces the discrepancy [54]. We aim to study how different
architectures and identifier designs will affect the alignment and
generalization during inference in future works.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have offered new insights intoGR from the per-
spective of MVDR that both paradigms share the same frameworks
for measuring the relevance between a query and a document.
Both paradigms compute relevance as a sum of products of query
and document vectors and an alignment matrix. We have explored
how GR applies this framework and differs from MVDR. We have
shown that GR has simpler document encoding and an alignment
strategy with different sparsity and direction. They also share a
low-rank property and can be decomposed into query and docu-
ment components. We have conducted extensive experiments to
verify our conclusions and found that both methods have com-
monalities of term matching in the alignment. We also found that
query-to-document alignment direction has better performance
than document-to-query.
Based on our findings, practitioners in the field may consider
leveraging the shared frameworks highlighted in this study to un-
derstand and develop new GR methods, and pay more attention to
the classic term matching problem underlying GR models.
As to future work, we will continue to study how multi-layer
attention may affect the framework. The difference in the general-
ization properties for new documents between DR and GR [4, 27,
29, 52] base on our framework is also an important aspect deserving
further investigation. We will continue to discover new relations in
the GR paradigm and provide more insights into the methodology.

A FURTHER EXPLANATION OF THE
RELEV ANCE SCORE IN GR
Further insights into the reason for using Í
𝑖 ∈ [𝑀 ] 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 as the
relevance can be elaborated as follows. Suppose we treat all other
token embeddings 𝑒𝑘, where 𝑘 ≠ 𝑑𝑖, as fixed with respect to 𝑒𝑑𝑖 ,
the loss can be expressed as:
L𝑖 (𝑑, 𝑞) = −𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 + log©­
«
exp 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 +
∑︁
𝑣≠𝑑𝑖
exp 𝑒⊤

ª®
¬
(26)
= −𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 + log

exp 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 + 𝐶

. (27)
Given that 𝐶 ≫ exp 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 at the early stage of the training, we can
consider the last term log(exp 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 + 𝐶) as a constant w.r.t. 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖.
Hence,
log 𝑝 (𝑑𝑖 | 𝑑𝑖 −1, . . . , 𝑑0, 𝑞) = L𝑖 (𝑑, 𝑞) ∝ 𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖, (28)
and further we have
log 𝑝 (𝑑 | 𝑞) = L (𝑑, 𝑞) =
∑︁
𝑖
L𝑖 (𝑑, 𝑞) ∝
∑︁
𝑖 ∈ [𝑀 ]
𝑒⊤
𝑑𝑖
ℎ𝑖 . (29)
In summary, the dot-product can effectively indicate the relevance
between document 𝑑 and query 𝑞.

B PROOF OF LEMMA 5.1
Proof. We define 𝑅𝑑 = 𝐷 − 1𝑑⊤, where 𝑑 = arg min ∥𝐷 −
1𝑑⊤ ∥. 𝑅𝑞 is defined similarly for 𝑄. Then we have
𝐷⊤𝑊 𝑄 = (𝑑⊤𝑊 𝑞 + 𝑅𝑑 𝑊 𝑞)1⊤ + ( 1𝑑⊤𝑊 𝑅⊤
𝑞 + 𝑅𝑑 𝑊 𝑅⊤
𝑞 ),
therefore, 𝐴 = softmax(𝑅𝑑 𝑊 𝑅⊤𝑞 + 1𝑟⊤).
Let 𝑅 = 1𝑟⊤, according to Lemma A.3 in [ 7], we have ∥𝐴 −
𝑅∥1,∞ ≤ 4𝛾 2 ∥𝑅𝑑 𝑊 𝑅⊤𝑞 ∥1 ≤ 4𝛾𝐶 ∥𝑊 ∥1, where 𝐶 depends on 𝑅𝑑
and 𝑅𝑞. □
C PROOF OF LEMMA 5.2
Proof. Given that 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = exp(𝑑⊤
𝑖 𝑞𝑗 )/𝑝𝑖 𝑗, where 𝑝𝑖 𝑗 is the nor-
malization, we can kernelize exp(·) term as 𝜙 (𝑑𝑖 )⊤𝜙 (𝑞𝑗 ), and
rel(𝑑, 𝑞) =
∑︁

D T5 V ARIANTS OF COLBERT AND SEAL
The official ColBERTv1 uses pair-wise contrastive loss for training,
which is inefficient. Therefore, we use in-batch negatives and com-
pute all negative samples simultaneously in each iteration. We set
the batch size to 256 and train 5 epochs. Using in-batch negatives
will greatly save training time without decreasing the performance
much. We summarize our comparison results in Table 7. We also
compare the end-to-end performance of T5-ColBERT and T5-SEAL
with other commonly used baselines in Table 8.
Table 7: Comparison of our in-batch negative variant of T5-
ColBERT and ColBERT with official ColBERTv1 [ 15]2 on
