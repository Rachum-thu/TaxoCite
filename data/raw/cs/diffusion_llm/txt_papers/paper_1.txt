ABSTRACT
Aligning users across multiple heterogeneous social networks is
a fundamental issue in many data mining applications. Methods
that incorporate user attributes and network structure have re-
ceived much attention. However, most of them suffer from error
propagation or the noise from diverse neighbors in the network.
To effectively model the influence from neighbors, we propose a
graph neural network to directly represent the ego networks of
two users to be aligned into an embedding, based on which we
predict the alignment label. Three major mechanisms in the model
are designed to unitedly represent different attributes, distinguish
different neighbors and capture the structure information of the
ego networks respectively.
Systematically, we evaluate the proposed model on a number
of academia and social networking datasets with collected align-
ment labels. Experimental results show that the proposed model
achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art
comparison methods (+3.12-30.57% in terms of F1 score).

e 1: Illustration of the user alignment task. Given two
networks G s and G t , we aim at aligning user v1 from G s and user
u1 from G t . The lines between users within each network represent
the relationships between users. The lines between users across the
two networks denote whether two users are aligned or not, where
the black dashed lines mean they may be the same person, but the
actual labels are unknown, and the red solid line represents the
alignment between the target users to be predicted.
our different interests. A study conducted by IPG Media Lab shows
that over 50% US adults use more than one social media platform 1.
Aligning the same users across different social networks has re-
cently been attracting considerable attention, as it can provide a
comprehensive view of users’ profile, and then benefit many appli-
cations. For example, linking users of a E-Commerce system and
a social media platform can enable product recommendation from
the E-Commerce system to the social media platform, and linking
users across different social networks can tell us how the informa-
tion is diffused between them.
One intuitive way to align same users across social networks is
to compare the profile attributes such as name, affiliation, descrip-
tion, etc. However, the profile attributes usually cannot provide
sufficient evidence. For example, in Figure 1, it is difficult to deter-
mine that v1 and u1 are the same person only according to their
names “W. Wang" and “Wei Wang". Fortunately, the neighbors of
the two users in their respective ego networks 2 may provide ad-
ditional clues. Among the neighbors of v1 and u1, “Shi YL" from
“Peking University" and ‘Shi Yuan-Le" from “PKU" have a high pos-
sibility to be a same person, similarly for “J. Li" being interested

in “machine learning" and “J. Li" being interested in “deep learn-
ing". The clues would be more powerful if there are more potential
same neighbor pairs. In the Figure, the neighbors of v1 and u1 that
have a high possibility to be the same person are linked by black
dashed lines. In practice, most of the neighbor pairs are unlabeled,
which prevents us from directly calculating the metrics like Jac-
card’s coefficient or Adamic/Adar based on the shared neighbors
as that proposed in [7, 8, 26, 30]. One way to leverage the unla-
beled information is to estimate the possibility that a user pair can
be matched, based on which we can update the matching scores of
its neighbor pairs [9, 27, 28]. For example, SiGMa [9] proposed an
unsupervised method to iteratively propagate the matching scores
from a confidential seed set of user pairs to their neighbor pairs.
COSNET [28] proposed a supervised method to infer the marginal
probabilities that two users can be matched based on the attributes
of the two users and the marginal probabilities of their neighbor
pairs. Essentially, to predict the label of a user pair, they both need
to infer the labels of its neighbor pairs, and this may cause error
propagations during the iterative process.
Despite existing studies on user alignment [7–9, 26–28, 30], the
problem still poses several unsolved challenges. First,how to unit-
edly model profile similarity?Traditional methods usually com-
pare different profile attributes by human defined metrics, such as
Jaro-Winkler similarity [25], TF-IDF based cosine similarity [7, 20],
etc. However, they cannot capture the semantics of different literal
strings. Thus, a unified way with little effort of feature engineer-
ing to better represent different profile attributes is worth study-
ing. Second, How to deal with diverse neighbors in different
social networks? The neighbors of a user in different networks
can be very diverse due to the various purposes of different social
media platforms. For instance, people use Twitter to communicate
with friends and obtain information, while they use LinkedIn to
find a job. Leveraging all neighbors’ information without distinc-
tion may contrarily bring in additional noise. Third,How to incor-
porate the influence of network topologies? Different topolo-
gies of ego networks may exert different effects. For example, in
Figure 1, neighbor pair (v3; u3) is linked to another neighbor pair
(v4; u4), i.e., v3 is v4’s friend in Gs and u3 is u4’s friend in Gt . The
linkage reduces the possibility that v3 is wrongly matched to u3,
and v4 is wrongly matched to u4, and it further provides strong
evidence that v1 and u1 are the same person, compared with the
situation that (v3; u3) and (v4; u4) are not linked.
To deal with the above challenges, we formalize the task of user
alignment across social networks as a classification problem using
the ego networks of two users as input. We propose a graph neural
network model—MEgo2Vec to represent the matched ego network
between the two users into a low-dimensional real-valued repre-
sentation, based on which we align the users. The representation
includes two parts, one is embedded from the attributes of the tar-
get user pairs and their neighbor pairs, the other is embedded from
the topologies of the matched ego network. Specifically, first, to
unitedly model the profile attributes, we adopt a multi-view
embedding mechanism to represent the character-view and word-
view features for an attribute together. Second,to tackle the issue
of diverse neighbors in different networks, we adopt attention
mechanisms to convolve neighbors’ attributes, so as to distinguish
their influence. Three attentions are proposed to respectively con-
sider the individual characteristics of each user in a pair, the simi-
larity between two users in a pair, and the relationship of a neigh-
bor pair with the user pair to be predicted. Third, to capture the
influence of network topologies , we adopt a CNN network to
convolve the adjacency matrix of the matched ego network.
The main contributions can be summarized as:
 We propose MEgo2Vec (embed the M

), a novel graph neural network model, to formalize
our problem as a unified optimization framework.
 The multi-view node embedding can model the literal and
semantic characteristics of different attributes unitedly; the
attention mechanism can distinguish the effects of different
neighbors to alleviate error propagations; structure embed-
ding can capture the influence of different topologies.
 Experiments on a number of academia and social network-
ing datasets demonstrate that the proposed model compares
favorably classification accuracy (+3.12-30.57% in terms of
F1 score) against the state-of-the-art models for user align-
ment task.
2 RELATED WORK
User Alignment. One intuitive way to align users across social
networks is to compare users’ attributes, among which name is
the most important one. Many attempts have been made to study
how to leverage user names [11, 13, 17, 24, 25]. For example, Za-
farani et al. dealt with user names by adding or removing their
prefix/postfix [24]. They further made a comprehensive study of
the habits when users select names [25]. For other attributes like
the post contents of users, Kong et al. [7] calculated the cosine sim-
ilarity of the bag-of-words vectors weighted by TF-IDF.
However, user attributes may be missed or not strong enough to
indicate a user’s identity. Thus a lot of research utilizes the network
structure to enhance the prediction performance. Some of them cal-
culated the metrics like Jaccard’s coefficient or Adamic/Adar based
on the number of the shared neighbors [7, 30]. However, most of
the neighbor pairs are unlabeled, preventing us from calculating
the above metrics. Some methods such as IONE [12] and PALE [15]
learned user embeddings by encoding the structure information of
the network but totally ignored user attributes, and it is not easy
to add user attributes into their models.
Several research incorporates both user attributes and unlabeled
neighbor pairs together. For example, Lacoste et al. solved the prob-
lem by an unsupervised propagation method [9], where the sim-
ilarities of the attributes in the method are defined empirically.
Zhong et al. proposed an unsupervised co-training algorithm to
incorporate attributes and relationships with the neighbor pairs
together [29]. Zhang et al. further formulated the propagation pro-
cess based on attributes and network topologies from an optimiza-
tion perspective [27], but only one attribute can be considered in
their model. Zhang et al. proposed a supervised model—COSNET
to iteratively infer the labels of the unlabeled pairs and update the
model based on the inferred labels and the user attributes [28].
However, error propagations may be introduced in above meth-
ods. This paper aims at investigating a supervised method that

avoids label propagation, but directly represents a pair of users by
their attributes, their neighbors’ attributes and the network struc-
ture among the neighbors, and then aligns the users based on the
learned representations.
Neural Networks on Graphs. Substantial research has been done
on modeling the graph-structured input by neural networks. Shal-
low models such as DeepWalk [18], LINE [21] and node2vec [5]
learn node embeddings via the prediction of the first-order or high-
order neighbors. Graph neural networks (GNNs) were proposed as
a generalization of the recursive neural networks, which assign a
state to each node in a graph based on the states of neighboring
nodes [4, 19]. Recently, Li et al. improved GNNs using gated recur-
rent units and also extended the output to sequences [10].
Several works studied how to generalize convolutions to graph
data [1, 3, 6, 16, 23]. For example, Niepert et al. [16] generated a
representation for a selected sequence of nodes that covers large
parts of a given graph, and then used CNN to predict the label of
the graph. Duvenaud et al. defined convolutions directly on graphs
and learned node degree-specific weight matrix. [3]. Thomas et al.
considered a single weight matrix per layer and dealt with vary-
ing node degrees by an appropriate normalization of the adjacency
matrix [6]. Veličković et al. [23] introduced the attention mech-
anism into the graph convolutional networks to distinguish the
influence of the neighbors. Inspired by these recent works, we pro-
pose a graph neural network model to align users in two networks.
Most of the recent work on graph convolutional networks feed the
whole graph as the input, which hinders the mini-batch training
process. The proposed method in this paper, on the contrary, is
performed on ego networks of two nodes, which is able to adapt
to mini-batch training and thus can be conducted efficiently.
3 PROBLEM DEFINITION
In this section, we will provide necessary definitions and then for-
mally formulate the problem. Let G = (V ; A; P) denote an undi-
rected attribute augmented social network3, whereV is set of users.
Notation A represents a jV j  jV j adjacency matrix with an element
ai j indicating there is a relationship between vi and vj . Notation
P represents a jV j  d property (attribute) matrix with an element
pik indicating the k-th attribute of the i-th user in G.
Definition 3.1. Ego Network. Given a user vi 2 V , we use
Gi = (Vi ; Ai ; Pi )  G to denote vi ’s ego network, where Vi  V
contains the focal node vi (i.e., the node in the center) and vi ’s
first-order neighbors in G. Notation Ai  A is the adjacency ma-
trix representing the relationships between the users in Vi and Pi
represents an jVi j  d attribute matrix of the users in Vi .
We only consider first-order neighbors, out of the consideration
of the computational efficiency and the assumption that high-order
neighbors usually provide weak evidence on identifying a user. We
assume that two users are more likely to be the same person, if
there are more neighbors in their respective ego networks that
have a high possibility to be matched as the same person. Based
on the intuition, we define matched ego network as:
3W
e simply ignore the direction of a directed relationship as it is found to be not very
useful in the task.
Definition 3.2. Matched Ego Network. Suppose we have a source
network Gs and a target network Gt . Given two users vi 2 Gs
and ui 2 Gt , we denote vi ’s ego network as Gs
i and ui ’s ego net-
work as Gt
i . Then we construct a matched ego network GM
i =
(V M
i ; AM
i ; PM
i ) with each node in it as a pair of users from the two
ego networks by the following steps:
(1) Add the pair of users (vi ; ui ) into V M
i as the focal pair.
(2) Find all the potential matched neighbors of vi and ui , and
add them into V M
i as the neighbor pairs (More explanations
are as follows).
(3) Add an edge between (vi ; ui ) and each neighbor pair. Ad-
ditionally, add an edge between two neighbor pairs (vj ; uj )
and (vk ; uk ) if there is an edge betweenvj and vk in Gs , and
also an edge between uj and uk in Gt . Notation AM
i is the
adjacency matrix of GM
i .
(4) Notation PM
i represents an jV M
i j  2d attribute matrix with
each row pj as a concatenation of vj ’s attributes p(vj ) and
uj ’s attributes p(uj ), i.e., pj = (p(vj ); p(uj )) .
We will explain what are the potential matched neighbors, and
why and how they are constructed. The potential matched neigh-
bors are the neighbor pairs that have some possibility to be matched,
and they are filtered from all possible pairs of the neighbors. Due
to the various purposes of different social media platforms, the
neighbors in two ego networks may be very diverse. Directly us-
ing all pairs of neighbors as evidence to align users may introduce
much noise. Thus we propose an attention based mechanism to dis-
tinguish different neighbor pairs in our model (See details in Sec-
tion 4). To improve the computational efficiency, before resorting
to the model, we can easily select the most useful neighbor pairs by
heuristic rules [28]. This paper simply selects the neighbor pairs if
their names are similar, i.e., the Jaro-Winkler similarity of the two
names is larger than a threshold, as the potential matched pairs. We
also restrict the neighbor pairs to satisfy the one-to-one mapping
constraint as Kong et al. did in [7], based on the same assumption
that a user usually maintains one major account in each social me-
dia platform. Thus the constructed matched ego network has no
more than minfjV s
i j; jV t
i jg user pairs. We use N M
i to represent the
set of the neighbor pairs of (vi ; ui ) including (vi ; ui ) itself.
Problem 1. User Alignment across Social Networks: Given a
set of matched ego networks fGM
i = (V M
i ; EM
i )g constructed from
a pair of a source network Gs and a target network Gt , we aim at
learning a predictive function
f : GM
i = (V M
i ; EM
i ) ! yi (1)
to predict whether vi and ui belong to the same person in the real
world, where yi is a binary value, with 1 indicating vi and ui are the
same person, and 0 otherwise.
4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Overview
We argue that the above defined classification performance can be
improved if the node attributes and the structure of the matched
ego network are elaborately represented. The overview process of
the proposed method is shown in Figure 2.

Figur
e 2: The Overall process of the proposed method. (a) Extract the ego networks of the two users to be predicted; (b) construct a
matched ego network for the two users; (c) input the attributes of all the nodes and the adjacency matrix of the matched ego network to the
model; (d) embed the attributes and the structure information by MEgo2Vec; (e) output an embedding for the matched ego network.
Candidate Generation. In practice, the number of all the user
pairs across two networks is very large. Thus, we need to generate
candidate user pairs from all the pairs. Following [17, 28], we only
keep the user pairs if their names are similar to each other (Cf.
Section 5 for the details).
Matched Ego Network Construction. For each candidate pair
(v1; u1), we extract their ego networksGs
1 and Gt
1 from their respec-
tive networks (Figure 2(a)), and construct a matched ego network
GM
1 according to definition 3.2 (Figure 2(b)). Figure 2 is correspond-
ing to the case in Figure 1, where v2, v3 and v4 are matched to u2,
u3 and u4 respectively. User v5 in Gs is not matched to any user in
Gt , so it is removed from GM
1 . Note that a matching between two
users only indicates that they have the potential possibility to be a
same person, but the true label is usually unknown.
Matched Ego Network Embedding. We take the attributes of
all the node pairs in GM
1 and the adjacency matrix of GM
1 as the in-
put of the proposed model—MEgo2Vec whose output is an embed-
ding. The model consists of two components: attribute embedding
and structure embedding . The component of attribute embedding
adopts the attributes as input, and generates two embeddings Hv1
and Hu1 for v1 and u1. Specifically, we first generate an embedding
vector for each user in GM
1 based on his/her attributes by the pro-
posed multi-view node embedding mechanism (Figure 3), and then
update the embeddings of the focal pair (v1; u1) through convolv-
ing their neighbors’ embeddings by the proposed attention mecha-
nism (Figure 4). The component of the structure embedding adopts
the adjacency matrix AM
1 as input, normalizes and convolves AM
1
into another embedding t1 (Section 4.3).
Finally, we predict the label of(v1; u1) based on the combination
of the attribute embeddings and the structure embedding, and cal-
culate the loss according to the ground truth. We will explain the
details of different components as follows.
4.2 Attribute Embedding
Node Embedding. Many works demonstrate the effectiveness of
CNN in representing texts [14]. However, in our task, there are
multiple attributes for each user, and different attributes present
different characteristics when they are used to determine whether
two users are the same person or not. For example, in our datasets,
more than 70% users change a few characters in their nicknames on
different social media platforms. In this case, although the whole
words of their names are totally different, the characters in those
names are highly correlated. But for other attributes of long texts
such as research interests, words may make more effects than char-
acters. To model both the literal and semantic characteristics of the
attributes unitedly, we propose a multi-view node embedding strat-
egy. We will introduce the details as below.
We divide each attribute into a list of words. For each word in
an attribute, we firstly represent it as an embedding vector, named
as word-view embedding. Then we divide the word into a list of
characters, represent each character as an embedding vector, con-
volve all the character embeddings by a CNN network and output
an embedding as the word’s character-view embedding. The word-
view and character-view embeddings are concatenated as the final
embedding for a word. Then the sequence of the word embeddings
in an attribute are convolved by another CNN network to output
the final embedding for the attribute. Finally, we use an attribute
pooling strategy to aggregate the embeddings of all the attributes
of a node together as the node embedding:
vi =
d∑
k =1
aik γk ; (2)
where aik represents the embedding of the k-th attribute of user
vi , γk 2 R is the corresponding weighting parameter to be learned,
d is the number of attributes of a user and vi is the K-dimension
embedding learned for user vi . Figure 3 illustrates the above multi-
view node embedding mechanism, where all the attributes are dealt
with in the same way as name.
Social Convolution. To determine whether two users can be
aligned or not, the missing attributes or the attributes that are not
distinguishable enough usually cannot provide sufficient evidence.
But additional evidence may be obtained from the attributes of
the neighbors. Thus after we obtain the embedding for each node

based on their own attributes, we further smooth each node’s em-
bedding by their neighbors’ embeddings.
The general idea of social convolution is that, for the focal pair
(vi ; ui ) to be predicted, we convolve the above obtained embed-
dings of all its neighbor pairs f(vj ; uj ) : j 2 N M
i g (including the
embeddings of the focal pair itself, i.e., (vi ; ui )) into new embed-
dings of the focal pair:
(Hvi ; Hui ) = c (f(vj ; uj ) : j 2 N M
i g); (3)
where Hvi ; Hui 2 RK . The convolution operation c () can be defined
in various ways. A straightforward way to define c () is to average
the embeddings of all the neighbors together, i.e.,
Hvi = 1

However, different neighbor pairs may exert different effects.
For aligning two users, some neighbor pairs may provide strong
evidence, while others may bring in additional noise. Although we
have already filtered out most of the neighbors pairs if their names
are totally different when constructing the matched ego network
for a focal pair, the rule to filter neighbor pairs is heuristic and
is very likely to keep the wrongly matched neighbor pairs in the
matched ego network. Thus, it is necessary to distinguish the ef-
fects from different neighbor pairs. Recently, the attention mecha-
nism used in neural networks is a well-adopted way to achieve the
goal [2]. Inspired by this, we propose using attention mechanisms
to realize the social convolution operation c ().
Essentially, attention mechanism is introduced to determine the
contribution of a neighbor pair to the focal pair. Formally, given
the embeddings of a neighbor pair (vj ; uj ) and the embeddings of
the focal pair (vi ; ui ), we perform a shared attentional mechanism
д : RK  RK  RK  RK ! R on the four input embedding vectors
to calculate the attention coefficient:
eji = д(vj ; uj ; vi ; ui ); (5)

e 5: Illustration of different attention mechanisms that
determine the contribution of a neighbor pair (vj ; uj ) on pre-
dicting the label of a focal pair (vi ; ui ).
where eji indicates the contribution of (vj ; uj ) on predicting whether
vi and ui are the same person or not. Then we apply the softmax
function to obtain the normalized coefficients across all the neigh-
bor pairs of (vi ; ui ):
αji = softmaxj (eji ) = exp(eji )∑
j′ 2
N M

exp(ej′i ) : (6)
The normalized coefficients are used to compute a linear combi-
nation of the embedding vectors corresponding to them. Then we
apply a non-linear function σ () on the linear combination, which
is regarded as a final embedding vector for a user:
Hvi = σ (
∑
j 2N M

αji vj ); Hui = σ (
∑
j 2N M

αji uj ): (7)
Figure 4 illustrates the social convolution process. We design the
attention mechanisms based on the knowledge in vj , uj , vi and ui .
Three specific attention mechanisms are proposed progressively
by considering individual features of each user in a neighbor pair
(feature attention), the similarity between two users in a neighbor
pair (difference attention ) and the relationship of a neighbor pair
with the focal pair (relation attention ).
 Feature Attention. The assumption of feature attention is
that a neighbor pair (vj ; uj ) makes more contribution on in-
ferring the label of the focal pair (vi ; ui ) if the features of vj
and uj are more discriminative. For example, the neighbor
pair with the same name "Jaspher Wang" benefits more on
predicting the label of (vi ; ui ) than the neighbor pair with
the same name "Wei Wang", as the name "Jaspher Wang" is

more unique than "Wei Wang". According to this assump-
tion, we calculate the attention coefficient based on the con-
catenation of the embeddings of the neighbors in a pair:
eji = WT [vj ; uj ] + b; (8)
where notations W and b in this and the following equations
are the model parameters to be learned. The concatenation
of the embeddings reserves the features of the two users.
 Difference Attention. The assumption of difference attention
is that a neighbor pair (vj ; uj ) takes a more important role
on predicting the label of (vi ; ui ) if the two neighbors vj
and uj are more similar to each other. Under this assump-
tion, we calculate the attention coefficient solely based on
the difference between the embeddings of the neighbors:
eji = WT jvj   uj j + b; (9)
where we use the difference between two embeddings to
represent whether two neighbors are similar or not.
 Relation Attention. The assumption of relation attention is
that a neighbor pair (vj ; uj ) takes more effects on determin-
ing the label of (vi ; ui ) if the relationship between user vj
and vi in Gs share the same semantics with the relationship
between user uj and ui in Gt . For example, if we already
know user x in Twitter is aligned to user a in MySpace, and
user y in Twitter is aligned to user b in MySpace, suppose x
shares the same interest with y in Twitter, then most proba-
bly a also shares the same interest withb in MySpace. Under
this assumption, we calculate the attention coefficient by
comparing the difference between the embeddings of two
users in two networks:
eji = WT jj vj   vi j   j uj   ui jj + b; (10)
where we use the difference between two users, e.g.,jvj  vi j,
to represent the semantics of the relationship between the
users vj and vi , and then use the difference between the re-
lationship semantics to represent whether the two relation-
ships are similar or not.
Figure 5 illustrates the knowledge that is used to infer the at-
tention coefficient of (vj ; uj ) on (vi ; ui ). We can also consider the
knowledge used in all the three attention mechanisms and unify
them in one equation:
eji = WT [vj ; uj ; jvj   uj j; jj vj   vi j   j uj   ui jj ] + b: (11)
The unified attention mechanism is used in our final model.
4.3 Structure Embedding
Different from attribute embedding, the component of structure
embedding aims at embedding the structure information of the
matched ego network to predict the label of the focal pair. The
intuition is two users are more likely to be the same person if they
have more potential matched neighbor pairs, and furthermore, if
there are more neighbors know each other. For example, in Fig-
ure 2(b), the focal pair (v1; u1) has three potentially matched neigh-
bor pairs, which provides significant evidence on predicting the la-
bel of (v1; u1). In addition, neighbor pair (v4; u4) is linked to neigh-
bor pair (v3; u3), i.e, v4 knows v3 and u4 knows u3, which further
improves the probability that v1 and u1 are the same person. The
links between neighbor pairs reflect the structural characteristics
of the matched ego network, which can benefit the predicting task.
From the example, we can see that the structural roles of different
neighbor pairs are different when they are used to infer the label of
a focal pair. The core problem of leveraging the structure informa-
tion is to map the network structure to an embedding vector such
that the neighbor pairs with similar structural roles in different
matched ego networks are positioned similarly in the correspond-
ing embedding vectors. Inspired by [ 16], we address the problem
by firstly normalizing the adjacency matrix of the input matched
ego network and then applying a convolutional neural network on
the normalized graph to learn an embedding vector for the graph.
Normalization. Normalization aims at finding an order of the
neighbor pairs in each matched ego network to reserve the rela-
tive position of the neighbor pairs. The basic idea is two neighbor
pairs in different matched ego networks can be located at the sim-
ilar position of the respective adjacency matrix if their structural
roles within the matched ego networks are similar. Intuitively, a
neighbor pair can be ranked higher if it is more closer to the focal
pair. Multiple similarity metrics defined on graphs can be used to
measure the distance between two nodes such as common neigh-
bors, Jaccard Coefficient, SimRank, etc.
Structure Convolution. After we obtain a ranked list of node
pairs in GM
i , we get a new adjacency matrix ˆAM
i with the indexing
of the node pairs correspond to the ranked pairs. Then we apply a
convolutional neural network on the normalized adjacency matrix
ˆAM
i to learn an embedding vector for the adjacency matrix. Specif-
ically, we firstly pad dummy node pairs to the adjacency matrix
if the size of the pairs is smaller than a predefined number L, and
discard the pairs with indexing larger than L; then we reshape the
adjacency matrix to a L  L-dimension vector, and apply H differ-
ent L L-dimension convoluational kernels with 1 stride, to output
H -dimension embedding vector ti .
4.4 Objective Function
For each focal pair (vi ; ui ), we concatenate the difference between
their attribute embeddings Hvi and Hui , i.e., jHvi  Hui j and the structure
embedding ti . Then we apply a function f such as the full connec-
tion operation on the concatenation to predict the matching score
ˆyi = f (jHvi  Hui j; ti ). Finally we define the objective function as the
cross entropy loss of the true label and the predicted score:
L = 1
n
n∑
i=1
Cr
ossEntropy( f (jHvi   Hui j; ti ); yi ); (12)
where n is the total number of labeled user pairs.

EXPERIMENTS
5.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. We collect three Academia networks and two SNS net-
works4. Academia consists of networks collected from Aminer [22],
an academic searching and mining service, LinkedIn, a business-
and employment-oriented professional social network, and Vide-
oLectures, the world’s biggest academic online video repository.
SNS consists of Twitter, a well-known microblogging social plat-
form, and MySpace, a social networking website for users to share
blogs, photos and music. The details are summarized in Table 1.
We treat all the relationships in the networks as undirected ones
in our experiments. All data and codes are available online 5.
Training Data. An instance is a pair of users from two differ-
ent networks, where a positive instance means the two users be-
long to a same person, while a negative instance indicates they
are different persons. For the training data constructed across SNS
networks, the positive instances were collected by Perito el. al us-
ing Google Profile Service (GPS) [ 17]. GPS 6 allows users to pro-
vide their accounts on different online social networks, and the
accounts from same users can be treated as positive instances. For
those constructed across academia networks, the positive instances
were provided by the users in Aminer.org, where users can input
the links of their LinkedIn and ViedoLectures profile pages in their
Aminer profile pages. Negative instances should be constructed
as they cannot be directly collected by existing services. Follow-
ing the assumption that a user usually maintains one major ac-
count in each platform [7], we get that in most cases the users
appeared in positive instances cannot be aligned to others users.
Thus we sample several negative instances for each positive in-
stances. Specifically, for each positive instance (vi ; ui ) where vi
is from Gs and ui is from Gt , we randomly sample several nega-
tive partners from Gt for vi , and several negative partners from
Gs for ui . All the negative instances are sampled from the gen-
erated candidate pairs (Cf. Section 4.1). Finally, we keep the ratio
between positive and negative instances as about 1:10 and collect
33,981, 34,060 and 35,080 training instances for Aminer-LinkedIn,
Aminer-VideoLectures and Twitter-MySpace respectively.
For all the users in training data of Academia networks, we se-
lect the profile attributes of name, affiliation, education and re-
search interests/skills to compare. Although there are many at-
tributes in SNS networks, most of the attributes are extremely sparse.
Thus we only choose screen name, account name and locations to
compare for users in the training data of SNS networks.

Baseline Methods. The comparison methods include:
Exact Name Match(ENM): considers a user pair collected from
two networks as a positive instance if the name of a user is an exact
match to that of the other user in the pair. A user in one network
may match to multiple users with same names in the other net-
work.
SVM: defines the features as the Jaro-Winkler similarity of two
names, the edit distance of two names, and the cosine similarity
between the TF-IDF weighted word vectors of other attributes.
SVM+N: averages the values for each feature in SVM over all
the neighbor pairs in a matched ego network as additional features.
SiGMa [9]: begins from a seed set of user pairs (output by Name-
Match and then filtered out the most common names) and itera-
tively augments the seed set by propagating the matching scores
(predicted by SVM) through the two input networks.
COSNET [28]: is a factor graph model that incorporates the at-
tributes of two users as local factors (the same as SVM), and the
relationships between user pairs as correlation factors. The intu-
ition is two linked user pairs tend to be have the same labels.
MEgo2Vec: is the proposed model that incorporates the multi-
view node embedding, unified attention mechanism and the struc-
ture embedding together.
Variants of Our Model. We try seven variants of MEgo2Vec to
evaluate the effectiveness of different components one by one.
Multi-view Node Embedding: Firstly, to evaluate the effect of
the multi-view node embedding component, we ignore the compo-
nents of attention based social convolution and structure embed-
ding, and only embed the attributes of the focal pair itself. The
model is denoted as MEgo2Veccw . Additionally, we try word-view
and character-view embeddings separately, and denote them as
MEgo2Vecw and MEgo2Vecc respectively.
Social Convolution: Secondly, based on MEgo2Veccw , we add
the attribute embeddings of neighbor pairs to evaluate the effect
of the attention based social convolution component. The model
utilizes the unified attention mechanism and ignores the structure
embedding, and is denoted as MEgo2Vecu . Additionally, we try the
feature attention, difference attention and relation attention mech-
anisms separately, and denote them as MEgo2Vec f , MEgo2Vecd
and MEgo2Vecr respectively. We also simply average the attribute
embeddings of neighbor pairs and denote it as MEgo2Vec a , i.e., at-
tention coefficient αji is set as 1=N M
i .
Structure Embedding: Finally, based on MEgo2Vec u , we add
the structure embedding result to evaluate the effect of the struc-
ture embedding component. The model is denoted as MEgo2Vec
and is also the final proposed model.
Evaluation Strategies. We evaluate all the comparison methods
in terms of Precision, Recall and F1-Measure.
Implementaion Details. We implement the model by Tensor-
flow and run the code on an Enterprise Linux Server with 6 Intel(R)
Xeon(R) CPU cores (E5-2699 and 56G memory) and 1 NVIDIA Tesla
P40 GPU core (24G memory).
7Co-vie
w means two user profiles were viewed by a same user.

For
the academia networks, we select the candidate pairs if they
share the same firstname, and the same initials of the lastname.
For the SNS networks, we select the candidate pairs if their screen
names or account names share at least four 2-grams. When gen-
erating a matched ego network, the threshold to filter neighbor
pairs is set as 0.8. In node embedding component, the dimension
of word, character and attribute embedding is set as 64, 32 and 192
respectively. In social convolution component, the maximal num-
ber of neighbor pairs in a matched ego network is restricted to
14. Then we pad dummy neighbor pairs if the size of the pairs is
smaller than 14, and discard additional pairs otherwise. In struc-
ture embedding component, we use common neighbors as the sim-
ilarity metric to conduct graph normalization. Notation L denotes
the maximal number of neighbor pairs, and is also set as 14. The
dimension H , i.e., the output channel of CNN network, is set as
64. The learning rate of the model is set as 0.001. The size B of a
mini-batch is 100.
5.2 Performance Analysis
Overall Prediction Performance. Table 2 shows the overall per-
formance on three pairs of networks. The proposed method per-
forms clearly better than the comparison baselines on all datasets
(+3.12-30.57% in terms of F1 score). Our method improves more
F1 on the two academia datasets than on the SNS dataset, as the
attributes of the academia dataset are much richer than those of
the SNS dataset, which indicates neural networks are more suit-
able for the complex input dataset. ENM is essentially a rough rule
and performs poorly, as on one hand, it totally ignores the positive
instances with different names, and on the other hand, different
users with same names are wrongly identified as the same users.
SVM ignores the network information and defines features by hu-
man experience, which is not comprehensive enough to represent
the attributes. SVM+N leverages the attributes of neighbors, but it

does not distinguish the effects of different neighbors. SiGMa re-
sults in high precision but suffers from a low recall. Because the
overlap between the input two networks is low, leading it not easy
to propagate the matching scores from the seeds to other pairs.
COSNET essentially propagates the inferred labels in the whole
matched network, thus it may suffer from error propagation. Be-
sides, the features in COSNET is also human defined. MEgo2Vec
uses a graph neural network to embed the neighbors’ attributes
and the structure information, which can capture both the literal
and semantic characteristics of the attributes, and meanwhile alle-
viate error propagations through the network.
On the academia datasets, processing 100 mini-batches requires
150 seconds, and best validation F1 is reached after 20-40 epoches
(about 270 mini-batches per epoch) through the data, which re-
quires 2-3 hours of training. On Twitter-MySpace, as the attributes
are extremely sparse, i.e., features are not sufficient, processing 100
mini-batches requires 25 seconds, but best validation F1 is reached
after 100-120 epoches (281 mini-batches per epoch), which requires
2 hours of training. We show the prediction performance of the dif-
ferent variants of our model on one academia dataset and one SNS
dataset in Figure 6 and analyze the results as follows.
Multi-view Node Embedding Effect. We compare two single
view models—MEgo2Vec w and MEgo2Vec c with the multi-view
model MEgo2Veccw , and show the results in Figure 6. We see that
MEgo2Veccw performs better than MEgo2Vecw (+1.69-2.48% in F1)
and MEgo2Vecc (+1.03-2.03% in F1), which demonstrates the strength
of the multi-view embedding mechanism when representing the

node attributes. MEgo2Vecc performs better than MEgo2Vec w , as
the similarity between the characters of names takes the most im-
portant role among all the attributes. Compared with MEgo2Vecw ,
MEgo2Vecc improves more F1 on Twitter-MySpace than on Aminer-
LinkedIn, as other attributes except name are extremely sparse on
the SNS dataset, thus characters in names dominate the effect.
Neighbor Pair Effect. To verify the effect of social convolution
component, based on MEgo2Veccw , we add the neighbors’ attribute
embeddings by the unified attention mechanism and find that the
model MEgo2Vecu performs much better than MEgo2Veccw (+2.60-
3.00% in F1). We further evaluate the instances with and without
neighbors separately on Aminer-LinkedIn and show the results in
Table 3. We can see that if predicted by MEgo2Vec u instead of
MEgo2Veccw , the performance is improved by 3.6% in F1 for the
instances with neighbors, but it is almost not improved for those
without neighbors. The results indicate that the neighbors’ infor-
mation captured by our method can indeed benefit the task. Note
that in the instances with and without neighbors, the ratio between
the positive and negative parts is different, so the performance is
different by the same method.
Social Convolution Effect. We compare the three attention mech-
anisms MEgo2Vecd , MEgo2Vecf and MEgo2Vecr and show the re-
sults in Figure 6. MEgo2Vecr and MEgo2Vecd perform better than
MEgo2Vecf on academic networks, as relation attention and dif-
ference attention determine the contribution of a neighbor pair by
comparing two neighbors’ difference or two relations’ difference,
while feature attention only considers the features of a user, but
ignores the difference between two users. But on Twiter-MySpace,
since the attributes in the SNS networks are quite sparse except
name, the relationships between users are not so easy to describe,
making MEgo2Vecf perform better than the other attentions. When
combining the three attention mechanisms as MEgo2Vec u does,
the performance is better than each individual attention mecha-
nism. MEgo2Veca averages neighbors’ embeddings. It performs al-
most the same as MEgo2Vec cw that totally ignores neighbors’ in-
formation. The results indicate that neighbor pairs may bring in
noise and it is necessary to carefully utilize the neighbors’ infor-
mation by attention mechanism.
Structure Embedding Effect. Based on MEgo2Vecu , we add the
structure embedding, and denote it as our final model MEgo2Vec.
The results in Figure 6 show that the performance can be improved
by 0.48-1.36% in terms of F1, which indicates that the structure in-
formation of the matched ego network is effectively modeled by
the structure embedding component, and can indeed benefit the
alignment task. But the effect is not so significant, as the connec-
tions between neighbor pairs in the collected datasets are sparse.
5.3 Case Study
Attention Coefficients. We analyze the attention coefficients
learned by the proposed attention mechanisms. Figure 7 shows a
case for predicting whether two “Osmar R. Zaiane"s in two ego
networks are the same person or not. We present the learned atten-
tion coefficients of each neighbor by MEgo2Vec r beside the edges.
It shows that the neighbor pair named Russell Greiner makes the

science" with Osmar. The relationship between Russell and Osmar
in the first network is quite similar to the relationship between
them in the second network. If calculated by MEgo2Vec d , Russell
also makes more contribution than other pairs, because the two
“Russell Greiner"s share the similar educations and interests.
Node Embedding Visualization. Figure 8 visualizes the node
embeddings before the social convolution operation, i.e., (vi ; ui ),
and the embeddings after the social convolution operation, i.e.,
(Hvi ; Hui ), by MEgo2Vecu for 5 randomly selected positive and neg-
ative instances with neighbors respectively. The circle points are
the users in Aminer, and the triangle points are their partners in
LinkedIn. For the positive instances in Figure 8(a), the two users
in a pair become more similar to each other after the social convo-
lution operation, but for the negative instances in Figure 8(b), the
two users in a pair do not tend to be more similar after the social
convolution operation, which indicates that the proposed model
can effectively leverage the neighbor pairs to align users.
Sturcture Embedding. Figure 9 shows a user pair ("X. Shirley
Liu, "Xiaole Liu") that is correctly predicted as the same person by
MEgo2Vec, but is wrongly predicted by MEgo2Vec u . The case is
difficult to be predicted, because firstly, the attributes of one net-
work is totally missing, and even the name of the two users are not
very similar; secondly, although there are two potentially matched
neighbor pairs ("Yong Zhang", "Yong Zhang") and ("Qian Wang",
"Qian Wang"), their attributes are very sparse in one network, thus
can not provide enough evidence. Fortunately, two neighbors know
each other in their respective networks, which is an important clue
to indicate that "X. Shirley Liu and "Xiaole Liu" are the same person.
The structure information can be well captured by the structure
embedding component of our model.
6 CONCLUSION
We present the first attempt to solve the problem of user align-
ment by a graph neural network model, which predicts whether
two users can be aligned or not by matching and embedding their
ego networks. The model deals with the issue of diverse neighbors
by distinguishing them using attention mechanisms. Meanwhile,
it captures both the literal and semantic characteristics of the at-
tributes by a multi-view embedding mechanism, and also captures
the structure of the matched ego network through normalizing and
convolving the adjacency matrix. The experimental results on dif-
ferent genres of datasets validate the effectiveness of the model.
