## 1. Introduction
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology [1–4], text classification has emerged as a pivotal technique in a wide range of applications [5]. Text classification is a technique that has been widely applied in information retrieval, data mining, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). To execute the task of text classification, users must first define the classes and extract relevant text features to construct an effective text classifier [6]. This process entails analyzing and categorizing text content, subsequently assigning one or more class labels. For instance, sentiment analysis is employed to evaluate and rate the sentiment expressed in product or movie reviews, while topic analysis is utilized to classify the themes of texts, such as those related to sports or education [7,8]. Text classification can be broadly categorized into document classification and sentence classification [9], depending on the granularity of the objects being processed [10]. Fundamentally, the primary objective of text classification is to employ computational tools to achieve human-level judgment capabilities, thereby enabling the accurate identification of a given text within a specific class [11]. Owing to its extensive applications in spam classification, question answering, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems, text classification has rapidly emerged as a prominent topic within the field of NLP [12–15].

The processing flow of text classification encompasses three primary stages: text preprocessing, text feature extraction, and the construction of classification models [16–18]. A significant challenge within this framework is the extraction of text features while maintaining the integrity of semantic information [19–22]. Recently, text classification methods leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as the predominant approach [23–25]. The primary advantage of this methodology lies in its ability to utilize external knowledge from PLMs, which enhances semantic understanding and improves the accuracy of text classification [26–28]. Among the most notable PLMs is BERT [29], a general-purpose language model trained on extensive text corpora, including Wikipedia. BERT’s training process involves optimization through two key tasks: Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).

This survey focuses on text classification techniques that utilize PLMs [26]. Specifically, PLMs grounded in the Transformer architecture can accept one or more labeled sequences as input, enabling text classification models to employ classification tokens [CLS] as class feature vectors without necessitating structural modifications [30,31]. Following a straightforward linear layer, these models can effectively accomplish text classification tasks.

Furthermore, by extracting features from PLMs and subsequently constructing specialized classification models for downstream tasks, researchers can leverage the general knowledge embedded within PLMs and fine-tune these models to enhance their performance in specific applications [32]. In recent years, a variety of text classification techniques based on PLMs have emerged [33], facilitating their application across diverse fields [34]. This proliferation of methods has led to significant advancements in text classification research and practical implementations, underscoring the need for a timely review and summarization of representative techniques. Such a review will enable researchers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of PLM utilization in text classification, as well as the achievements and challenges that remain.

Numerous reviews of text classification have been conducted from various perspectives. For instance, Bayer et al. [35] provide an extensive review of data augmentation methods in text classification, categorizing over 100 techniques into 12 distinct groups. Liu et al. [36] present a comprehensive overview of hierarchical multi-label text classification, while Wang et al. [17] focus on text classification methods based on graph neural networks. Additionally, Costa et al. [37] examine the application of embedding methods in text classification. Despite the existence of several review papers addressing the application of deep learning in text classification [12,17,19,35–37] and pre-trained language models [38–42], there remains a scarcity of comprehensive reviews that explore the combined application of these two domains.

The objective of this survey is to present a thorough summary and analysis of the advancements and trends in utilizing PLMs for text classification tasks. This survey builds upon existing literature in two specific dimensions: text classification and Transformer architectures. Unlike reviews that focus on conventional machine learning models, this survey emphasizes the application of PLMs based on the Transformer framework. It introduces classical deep learning text classification methods alongside those based on PLMs. This endeavor has the potential to significantly advance the field of text classification, given its prominence as one of the most extensively studied topics in NLP [5,15].

This survey aims to comprehensively examine the specific design aspects of PLMs that utilize the Transformer architecture. The discussion will encompass well-known PLMs [43], such as BERT [29] and GPT [44]. While recent surveys have explored various facets of the Transformer, including general Transformers [38], Visual Transformers [45], and Video Transformers [46], there are few comprehensive reviews that specifically address text classification based on PLMs. Although some surveys consider text classification [12,17,19,35–37], their scope, classification, and coverage are often limited, failing to encompass the common methods for text classification that rely on PLMs. To the best of our knowledge, no existing survey focuses exclusively on text classification based on PLMs. Consequently, this survey will concentrate on the intersection of PLMs and Transformers, exploring their applications and developmental trends within the domain of text classification.

This survey presents a thorough review of text classification techniques based on PLMs. The primary features of this survey include the following: (1) highlighting the advantages of PLMs in text feature extraction and their compatibility with diverse text classification methods, while also elucidating the intrinsic characteristics of PLMs from the perspective of text feature representation; (2) introducing classical deep learning-based text classification methods that possess the potential to significantly enhance classification performance; and (3) examining how PLMs grounded in the Transformer architecture are processed through self-attention mechanisms and their variants.

The survey comprises the following main sections:

## 2. Pre-trained language model
Inspired by the success of ImageNet in the field of computer vision [47], the domain of NLP has increasingly leveraged PLMs for a variety of tasks. The emergence of dynamic word embedding models, such as ELMo [48], has paved the way for the development of PLMs. Furthermore, PLMs based on the Transformer framework, such as BERT [29], have initiated a new era of fine-tuning paradigms in NLP. Typically, the methodology for utilizing PLMs involves two primary steps: first, a general model is trained on a large dataset until it achieves satisfactory performance [49,50]; second, the PLM is fine-tuned and adapted for specific tasks using targeted datasets [51–53]. With the rapid advancement of PLMs, they have become the predominant approach for addressing downstream NLP tasks.

### 2.1. Transformer
The attention mechanism was first proposed by Mnih et al. [54] in 2014 and was initially applied in the realm of computer vision. The authors introduced the attention mechanism to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for image classification, resulting in significant performance improvements. In 2015, Bahdanau et al. [55] further adapted the attention mechanism for NLP, employing it in machine translation, which similarly yielded noteworthy enhancements. The Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. [56], completely discarded traditional network structures such as RNNs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), relying exclusively on self-attention mechanisms [57–59]. This model can operate in parallel and effectively capture long-range dependencies, rendering it a powerful tool for various NLP tasks.

The Transformer model is constructed using an encoder–decoder architecture, which consists of two primary subnetworks: a self-attention module and a feedforward neural network. The self-attention module employs a multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the encoder to focus on distinct segments of the input sequence. Additionally, each subnetwork incorporates residual connections, which facilitate the retention of information across layers. The output of the encoder is a normalized feature vector that is subsequently processed by the decoder. The decoder comprises a self-attention module, a fully connected feedforward network, and an additional "encoder–decoder attention" module. This attention mechanism is interposed between the two subnetworks, enabling the decoder to attend to relevant portions of the encoded input sequence. Similar to the encoder, both modules in the decoder utilize residual connections and normalization operations to optimize information flow and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The mathematical representation of the residual connection and normalization operations in both the encoder and decoder can be expressed as follows:
𝑦 = 𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟(𝑥) + 𝑥) (1)
where 𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(⋅) denotes feature normalization operations.

The Residual Network (ResNet) [60] was developed to address the problem of degradation, which arises from challenges during training in deep CNN models. For a stack of layers, ResNet learns the residual 𝐹(𝑥) = 𝐻(𝑥) − 𝑥, where 𝐻(𝑥) denotes the learned feature and 𝑥 denotes the input. When 𝐹(𝑥) = 0, 𝐻(𝑥) = 𝑥, indicating that residual learning is simpler than learning raw features directly. In such cases, the stacked layers perform solely identity mappings, and network performance will not deteriorate. However, in practice, the residual is non-zero, enabling the stacked layers to learn novel features based on the input features and achieve superior performance. By introducing residual connections, ResNet facilitates the training of extremely deep networks and has attained better performance on a diverse range of tasks.

The Transformer model employs the self-attention mechanism to compute the output of the self-attention layer, as illustrated in Eq. (2):
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q × K^T / √dk) V (2)
Here, Q, K, and V represent the query, key, and value matrices, respectively. The dot product of Q and K is normalized by dividing it by the square root of the key dimension (which is also the query dimension), denoted as dk. This normalization prevents the dot product result from becoming excessively scattered when dk is large.

The multi-head mechanism in the self-attention layer offers multiple expressive pathways. Rather than a single set of Q, K, and V matrices, there are multiple sets under multi-head. The linear layer does not feature a non-linear activation layer, and a single fully connected neural network processes other sequence inputs in the same manner. These network parameters are shared, reducing the number of parameters required and improving model efficiency.

However, the structure of the self-attention mechanism lacks the sequential information necessary to capture the order of words in a sentence. If the order of words is altered, the features captured by the Transformer remain unchanged, which is unsuitable for certain NLP tasks. To address this limitation, the Transformer integrates positional embeddings into its word embedding layer to reflect the positional relationships between words in a text sequence [56]. This approach allows the Transformer to effectively encode the order of words, thereby enhancing its applicability to a wider range of NLP tasks.

### 2.2. BERT
The BERT model [29] represents one of the most influential advancements in the domain of PLMs. Through a self-supervised training approach, BERT enables the efficient acquisition of substantial semantic knowledge, demonstrating remarkable performance across a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, text classification, and text similarity analysis. Currently, BERT remains one of the most widely adopted PLMs [61]. Its architecture is based on the Transformer encoder, constructing a bidirectional deep language model. Furthermore, BERT integrates Masked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Prediction for joint bidirectional training. During the pre-training phase, MLM plays a pivotal role, allowing BERT to capture and comprehend bidirectional contextual semantic information, thereby enhancing the model’s overall performance.

In the pre-training phase of the MLM, BERT employs a random masking strategy, wherein specific words are replaced with a designated token, [MASK]. The model utilizes contextual cues to predict these masked words, thereby capturing and understanding contextual information. This training approach, referred to as self-supervised learning, is a variant of unsupervised learning that employs supervised-like techniques by leveraging information within the dataset itself to create pseudo-labels.

Establishing semantic relationships between sentences is crucial for various downstream NLP tasks. To facilitate the acquisition of semantic connections between sentences, BERT also incorporates the NSP task during pre-training. The NSP task involves determining whether a semantic connection exists between two sentences. The [SEP] token serves as a delimiter; if a semantic connection exists between the two sentences, the output is 1; otherwise, the output is 0.

Despite BERT’s significant achievements in NLP tasks, certain limitations persist in its application. The model exhibits a slower convergence rate during training, which may stem from inconsistencies between its pre-training and generation processes. Consequently, BERT’s performance may be suboptimal in certain natural language generation tasks, and it may not be well-suited for document-level NLP tasks, limiting its applicability primarily to sentence-level and paragraph-level tasks. To address these limitations and enhance performance in PLMs, researchers have proposed models such as AlBERT [62], which reduces model size by sharing parameters across layers and replaces the NSP task with the Sentence Order Prediction task, thereby improving overall model performance.

The ERNIE model [63] represents a knowledge-enhanced semantic representation framework that comprises two primary modules: the lower layer and the upper layer. The lower module functions as a text encoder, capturing fundamental vocabulary and sentence information from the input. In contrast, the upper module serves as a knowledge encoder, integrating knowledge information extracted from the lower layer into the text information. ERNIE’s training methodology uniformly models syntactic, lexical, and semantic information present in the training data, leveraging both MLM and NSP pre-training tasks to extract relevant information.

ELECTRA [64] addresses the inconsistency issue observed in BERT during the pre-training and fine-tuning stages by substituting MLM with token detection. This approach not only enhances the computational efficiency of the model but also improves its absolute performance. Similarly, MPNet [65] effectively utilizes the dependencies between predicted labels through permutation language modeling, while also incorporating auxiliary position information as input. This enables the model to perceive the entire sentence while minimizing the impact of positional differences.

For models based on the Transformer framework, the input sequence length is directly proportional to the model’s complexity. As the sequence length increases, the model requires a substantial amount of memory, which can reduce computational efficiency. To address this challenge, Dai et al. [66] proposed the Funnel Transformer, which tapers in the sequence direction as the number of layers increases, thereby economizing space overhead. Its training methodology is congruent with that of BERT, allowing for efficient processing of longer sequences while maintaining performance.

### 2.3. Transformer-XL
The standard Transformer model processes the entire sequence in parallel, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between sequence elements and generating the output sequence in a single pass. To facilitate this parallel processing, the model is restricted to fixed-length sequence inputs. Sequences that are insufficiently long require padding, while those that exceed the maximum length must be truncated. To address these challenges, Al-Rfou et al. [67] proposed a 64-layer Transformer decoder architecture for a character-level language model in 2018. This model employs a "segmented training plus sliding window inference" approach. While this method partially alleviates the issue of variable-length sequence inputs, the sliding window inference technique demands substantial computational resources, resulting in slower processing speeds.

To further overcome the limitations associated with input length, Dai et al. [68] introduced Transformer-XL in 2018. This model enhances the standard Transformer by allowing for the acceptance of arbitrary-length sequence inputs while improving training efficiency. Transformer-XL achieves its objectives through two core mechanisms. First, it implements a segmented recursive mechanism, which divides long sequences into shorter segments for individual processing. This approach reduces the model’s reliance on global sequence information and minimizes computational resource consumption. Second, Transformer-XL incorporates a relative position encoding mechanism, which enriches the model’s capacity to learn sequence structures by integrating relative positional information within each segment. Specifically, this mechanism employs a unique embedding method to capture the relative distances and order relationships among elements in the input sequence, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to comprehend complex patterns and improving its generalization capabilities. Consequently, the integration of segmented recursion and relative position encoding endows Transformer-XL with enhanced efficiency and accuracy in managing long sequence inputs, positioning it as a valuable asset in the fields of NLP and other domains that involve sequence data processing.

During the training phase, the Transformer-XL model utilizes an additional fixed-length storage space to preserve the hidden states of preceding segments. When processing the current segment, these stored hidden states interact with the current input, establishing a connection between the two segments. By introducing segmented recursion and relative position encoding, Transformer-XL effectively addresses the critical limitation of the standard Transformer model regarding arbitrary-length sequence inputs. The relative position encoding mechanism further facilitates the capture of distance information between distinct segments, thereby enhancing the model’s comprehension of the overall sequence structure.

XLNet [69] builds upon the Transformer-XL architecture as a pre-training model designed to tackle the challenges associated with processing long text sequences. XLNet inherits the pivotal mechanisms of segmented recursion and relative position encoding from Transformer-XL, enabling it to accept lengthy sequences as inputs while exhibiting rapid reasoning capabilities. During the pre-training stage, XLNet is trained on five extensive corpora, with a cumulative size exceeding 150 GB, thus providing the model with a vast amount of data. These corpora include BooksCorpus, Wikipedia, Giga5, ClueWeb 2012-B, and Common Crawl. Additionally, XLNet introduces a permutation language model that leverages a permutation mechanism, synthesizing the strengths of both autoregressive and auto-encoding language models while mitigating their limitations. This approach allows for effective modeling of language context dependencies. Furthermore, through the mechanisms of segmented recursion and relative position encoding inherited from Transformer-XL, XLNet enhances its capability to process long texts. Overall, the XLNet model successfully models language context dependencies by employing permutation mechanisms alongside the segmented recursion and relative position encoding of Transformer-XL, thereby significantly improving performance in various NLP tasks.

### 2.4. BART
The BART model [70] employs a Transformer architecture comprising standard 6-layer encoders and 6-layer decoders. During the pre-training phase, BART utilizes document recovery as its target task, wherein the input document sequence is intentionally corrupted, and the decoder is tasked with reconstructing the original sequence. This "destruction" and "restoration" process effectively serves to denoise the data. To simulate real-world document noise conditions, BART incorporates five distinct corruption methods during pre-training: symbol masking, symbol deletion, text filling, sentence rearrangement, and document rotation. For fine-tuning and adapting to various downstream tasks, the BART model provides tailored architectures and methodologies to accommodate different task types, including sequence classification, token classification, sequence generation, and machine translation.

In contrast, the T5 model [71] aspires to establish a unified framework that treats a wide array of NLP tasks as text-to-text tasks. This approach enables the execution of all NLP tasks using a consistent model, loss function, training regimen, and decoding process, encompassing activities such as reading comprehension, summary generation, and text classification. To achieve this objective, the T5 model incorporates several enhancements, including the removal of the Layer Normalization bias, the relocation of Layer Normalization outside the residual path, and the implementation of a distinct position embedding. These modifications significantly enhance the model’s generalization capabilities and robustness, allowing it to handle diverse NLP tasks with greater efficacy.

### 2.5. GPT
Transformer Decoder-based PLMs have demonstrated exceptional performance in language generation tasks, notably with models such as GPT achieving remarkable results across various NLP applications. GPT-2 capitalizes on larger datasets and model architectures for pre-training and introduces the innovative concept of zero-shot learning, wherein a pre-trained model can be directly applied to downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning. GPT-3 [44] further enhances this framework by increasing the parameter count to 175 billion and adopting a few-shot learning approach [72,73]. For each subtask, GPT-3 requires only 10 to 100 training samples, and in some instances, it can successfully complete tasks with as few as one training sample or even none. These features significantly enhance the model’s generalization capabilities, enabling it to effectively address a diverse range of NLP tasks.

Moreover, InstructGPT [74], a PLM based on GPT-3, is fine-tuned using human feedback to better align with user intent across various tasks. This development led to the creation of ChatGPT, which is specifically designed for reasoning and dialogue tasks. Building on the foundational principles of InstructGPT, ChatGPT incorporates instructional learning during retraining. This process involves manual evaluation of the responses generated by ChatGPT, followed by adjustments to the model parameters to facilitate the generation of answers that more closely align with human cognitive patterns. However, it is noteworthy that ChatGPT currently lacks the capability to utilize text classification datasets for direct fine-tuning. Researchers can only employ ChatGPT for a limited number of text classification tasks, and its performance in these tasks is generally inferior to that of other fine-tuned models based on open-source PLMs [75].

GPT-4 employs the same training methodology as GPT-3 to train ChatGPT, enabling it to handle multi-modal data. Following retraining, ChatGPT outperforms GPT-3 in Q&A tasks. With the development of the GPT series of models, Prompt Learning has emerged as a prominent research area [76–78]. Prompt Learning aims to facilitate large models in recalling the knowledge they acquired during the pre-training phase. For an input text x, a function f_prompt(⋅) exists that transforms x into prompt form ̂x.
̂x = f_prompt(x) (3)
The inclusion of prompts at the beginning or end of a sentence can significantly influence the model’s output.

In recent years, the increasing impact of the GPT series on the academic community has led to a continuous expansion in the scale of various PLMs. Numerous research initiatives are actively investigating the upper limits of model parameter sizes. For instance, the Gopher model [79] comprises 280 billion parameters, the Megatron-Turing NLG model [80] boasts 530 billion parameters, and the PaLM Chowdhery model [81] features 540 billion parameters. The emergence of these large-scale PLM models presents both new opportunities and challenges within the field of NLP.

## 3. Text classification method based on deep learning
The automated processing of diverse textual data is a fundamental aspect of NLP, with text classification serving as a critical task within this domain. Traditional methods for text classification can be broadly categorized into two groups: machine learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods. Conventional machine learning approaches often necessitate complex feature selection and extraction processes, and they frequently lack the capacity for robust feature detection. This limitation can result in suboptimal classification performance.

Early research in text classification employed various methodologies, including but not limited to support vector machines [82], naive Bayes [83], decision trees [84], logistic regression [85], and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) [86]. While these approaches were widely utilized, deep learning-based methods have emerged as a dominant paradigm due to their superior capabilities in feature detection and extraction, which arise from the adaptive nature of neural networks when processing textual data.

In contrast to traditional machine learning techniques, deep learning-based approaches leverage neural networks to automatically extract features from raw textual data, thereby eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This shift has led to enhanced performance across various text classification tasks [87,88], resulting in deep learning methods gradually supplanting traditional machine learning techniques in this field.

Deep learning-based methods employ deep neural networks to perform multi-level feature extraction and learning on textual data. These network architectures excel at capturing complex patterns and semantic information inherent in text [89–91]. In the context of applying deep learning to text classification, the preprocessing step involving word vector representation is particularly crucial. Word vector representation is a numerical encoding technique that facilitates the representation of textual data for computational processing.

Traditional word vector representations, such as one-hot encoding, often fail to effectively capture the spatial relationships between different words due to their lack of similarity information. To address this challenge, the Google team introduced a word vector representation tool called Word2Vec [92] in 2013. This method, trained on Google News data, is capable of capturing distance relationships between words more effectively, making it widely adopted in various NLP tasks. Another prominent tool for word vector representation is GloVe [93]. The integration of these tools has become a foundational element for NLP tasks. In most existing deep learning-based text classification methods, CNNs or RNNs are commonly employed for classification tasks [94,95]. However, the performance of deep learning algorithms is heavily contingent upon the quality of input features [96]. Consequently, significant research efforts have been devoted to the design of effective features [97,98] or the learning of expressive features from neural networks. Among these methods, Word2Vec and GloVe are often utilized as pre-training tools for neural networks [99–101], enabling the capture of distance relationships between features. Subsequently, various neural network architectures are employed to extract high-level features, forming the foundation for classification.

### 3.1. Text classification method based on CNNs
In 2014, Kim [10] introduced a text classification model based on CNNs, which demonstrated promising results in various text classification tasks, thereby validating the potential of deep learning approaches in this domain. Deep learning-based text classification models can be categorized into shallow neural networks [10,102], complex deep neural networks [103], and other variations, depending on the specific requirements of the task. When trained on substantial datasets, these models can significantly enhance the performance of text classification tasks.

The process of extracting features using CNNs involves two steps: the first step is to apply convolution operations to extract higher-level local features, and the second step is to aggregate these local features using max pooling. This reduces the complexity of the network while retaining the most significant and important text features. Each word in a sample is represented as ik ∈ R^m, which denotes the m-dimensional word vector of the kth word in a sentence. A sentence T is represented as:
T = i1, i2, … , ik (4)
Let wn ∈ R^(hk) represent the convolution filter used to convolve the word vector matrix. The feature yn is the new text feature obtained by convolving the sentence T using the convolution filter wn, as shown in Eq. (5).
yn = f(wn ⋅ T + b) (5)
Here, b ∈ R is a bias term, and f(⋅) represents an activation function. By convolving the sentence T with filters of different sizes, multiple local features can be obtained, forming a set of feature maps Y as shown in Eq. (6).
Y = [y1, y2, … , yn] (6)
To reduce network complexity while retaining significant features, max pooling operations are applied to the feature maps to find the maximum value among these features, as shown in Eq. (7).
z = max(Y) (7)
The pooling feature maps form the 6th layer of the network and are passed to the output layer using a fully connected network. After training and optimizing the network parameters, the probability distribution of the output classes is obtained. In the output layer, a classifier is built using a softmax function because its output represents a conditional probability distribution, as shown in Eq. (8).
softmax_j = exp(z) / ∑_{j=1}^C exp(y_j) (8)
Here, C represents the class, y is the input of the fully connected layer, which corresponds to the pooling feature maps.

The outlined process elucidates the application of CNNs for text classification, underscoring the successful implementation of deep learning in this area. For instance, Tang et al. [104] achieved commendable results in sentiment classification using CNNs while considering both user preferences and overall product quality. Some researchers have sought to incorporate word order information into shallow neural networks to enhance classification performance [102], while others have employed deeper neural networks for text classification. Notably, Zhang et al. [103] proposed a nine-layer neural network featuring up to six convolutional layers for feature extraction and three fully connected layers, specifically designed to process characters rather than words.

The character-level CNN [103] approach extracts local text features through the utilization of up to six convolutional layers, without necessitating knowledge of words or any linguistic or semantic structure. This methodology has demonstrated effective performance on large-scale text datasets. In 2016, Kim et al. [105] proposed a hybrid method that integrates convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract character-level text features, which can be applied to text classification tasks across multiple languages. Additionally, various research outcomes have provided novel solutions and insights for character-level text classification tasks [106,107].

### 3.2. Text classification method based on RNNs
RNNs have become widely adopted for text classification within the realm of deep learning [108]. These models excel at extracting relevant features by leveraging contextual information present in the text, making them particularly effective for handling long text datasets.

The Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) [109] represents a novel architecture that amalgamates the strengths of both CNNs and RNNs. It employs a recurrent structure to capture contextual information from text sequences while utilizing max pooling techniques to aggregate essential features. The RCNN not only enhances the accuracy of text classification but also reduces model complexity, thereby providing an effective solution for various text classification tasks and underscoring the pivotal role of RCNNs in deep learning-based text classification.

Additionally, Yang et al. [110] introduced a text classification model that incorporates an attention mechanism, which elucidates the significance of each text feature within the current document. This approach has been shown to enhance the accuracy of text classification to a notable extent. In 2017, Qin et al. [111] proposed a method utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to tackle the implicit text relation classification problem. Building upon this foundation, Liu et al. [112] developed a GAN-based adversarial multi-task learning framework aimed at addressing text classification challenges. Due to the inherent characteristics of GANs, this framework demonstrates strong performance in semi-supervised learning scenarios, effectively improving the accuracy of text classification, particularly in cases involving small sample sizes or insufficient labels [113].

Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been increasingly applied to text classification tasks. Yao et al. [114] presented a text classification model based on GNNs, followed by Liu et al. [115], who proposed a tensor graph convolutional network specifically designed for text classification. To overcome the limitations of existing GNNs in capturing contextual information, Zhang et al. [116] introduced a graph-based inductive text classification method. This innovative approach constructs a separate graph document for each text instance and employs GNNs to learn fine-grained local word representation structures.

### 3.3. Text classification method based on capsule network
The concept of capsule networks was first introduced by Sabour et al. [117] in 2017. In 2018, Wang et al. [118] proposed an innovative method for emotion classification that integrates RNNs with capsule networks to enhance classification accuracy. This approach capitalizes on the robust sequence modeling capabilities of RNNs and the advanced feature representation abilities of capsule networks, thereby offering a promising solution for sentiment classification tasks.

In the capsule network, a crucial step is to implement a routing algorithm to enable communication between two capsule layers. Specifically, this is achieved by facilitating information transfer between the PrimaryCaps layer and the DigitCaps layer to replace the fully connected layer. The length of the DigitCaps layer (L2 norm distance) represents the probability of class existence. The routing algorithm aims to determine an optimal coefficient A_ij to achieve the best information transmission effect. Initially, the coefficient A_ij is set to 1/k, which signifies that the next layer capsule is a weighted sum of each capsule in the previous layer, with equal initial weights. The goal of the routing algorithm is to discover the optimal weight coefficient.

Firstly, the coefficient A_ij is obtained through a variable B_ij, and its calculation process is determined by Eq. (9), where the initial value of B_ij is 0.
A_ij = exp(B_ij) / ∑_k exp(B_ik) (9)
After obtaining the coefficient A_ij, an intermediate variable s_j is calculated using Eq. (10).
s_j = ∑_i A_ij ⋅ W_ij ⋅ u_i (10)
Following this, v_j in the digital capsule layer is calculated using Eq. (11).
v_j = (s_j^2) / (1 + s_j^2) * s_j / |s_j| (11)
Finally, the new coefficient B_ij is calculated using Eq. (12), completing one routing iteration process.
B_ij = B_ij + W_ij ⋅ u_i ⋅ v_j (12)
Here, W_ij is a fixed shared weight matrix. Typically, after about three routing iterations, the capsule network attains optimal performance.

The final layer of the capsule network is the class layer, which utilizes the length of the capsule to indicate the probability of each class. The length of the output of the digital capsule layer represents the probability of the existence of a particular class, and the coefficient A_ij is updated through a routing algorithm, while other parameters and shared weight matrix W_ij are updated based on the loss function.

Yang et al. [119,120] investigated the capsule network model with a dynamic routing mechanism, presenting a novel solution for text classification tasks. By incorporating this dynamic routing mechanism, the model is better equipped to capture contextual information within the text, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Furthermore, in 2019, Zhao et al. [121] proposed a scalable and reliable capsule network model that exhibits strong adaptability to various data types and tasks, effectively supporting applications such as multi-label text classification and intelligent question answering.

In 2019, Chen et al. [122] introduced a transfer capsule network model that adeptly addressed the challenges associated with aspect-level sentiment classification by applying document-level knowledge transfer to sentiment analysis tasks. This model provided new insights for advancements in this field. In 2020, Wu et al. [11,14,15] presented a word-level capsule network for text classification, achieving significant progress in the application of capsule networks to natural language processing tasks.

## 4. Text classification method based on PLMs
Previous research predominantly utilized Word2Vec [92,101] or GloVe [93] as pre-training tools for text classification. However, since 2018, word-level text classification models based on BERT have gradually emerged as the dominant approach. BERT [29], a PLM developed by Google, has gained prominence due to advancements in self-supervised learning techniques, positioning PLMs as critical tools for visual and linguistic representation learning [123–126].

The process of employing the parameters of a PLM as initial parameters for related tasks is referred to as pre-training. By pre-training the model on large-scale unlabeled datasets and subsequently fine-tuning it on labeled data for specific tasks, the model can extract a wide array of common features, thereby alleviating the learning burden associated with specific tasks. Currently, fine-tuning PLMs for precise classification in text classification tasks has become a widely adopted methodology.

### 4.1. Text classification method based on fine-tuning
In recent years, PLMs have demonstrated substantial potential in text classification tasks. Notably, PLMs, particularly BERT, have been extensively applied across various NLP tasks, owing to the rich knowledge they accumulate during pre-training [127]. By constructing downstream task models based on PLMs as foundational models and fine-tuning these models, researchers can fully leverage the knowledge acquired from PLMs, thereby enhancing model performance [128,129].

Through self-supervised learning and the utilization of extensive corpora, PLMs acquire significant knowledge during the pre-training phase. For instance, BERT is founded on the Transformer Encoder architecture and employs English corpus data for self-supervised training, acquiring a considerable amount of semantic knowledge through masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks.

The construction of text classification models utilizing PLMs has emerged as a mainstream approach. Guo et al. [34] proposed a contrastive learning method to derive effective representations, which was applied to text classification based on BERT’s single-language embedding and to Alzheimer’s disease detection.

Chen et al. [130] enhanced model interpretability by visually representing different combinations of words and phrases within a hierarchical structure, thereby detecting the influence of features at varying levels. Croce et al. [131] introduced a semi-supervised generative adversarial network text classification method leveraging the BERT framework, wherein unlabeled data was employed to fine-tune the BERT architecture in a generative adversarial environment. Qin et al. [132] presented a feature projection method based on BERT to project neutral features for high-precision classification, thereby improving the performance of BERT-based text classification models.

This method employs two text encoders to extract label features and text sequence features. Various pre-trained models, such as BERT [29], can be utilized to extract text sequence features, which are then compared to achieve classification.

Here, S represents the text features extracted by the Encoder, which takes the text sequence D as input and obtains the text feature representation through the following function:
S = Encoder_S(D * w^T) (13)
In the above formula, w represents the operation of obtaining word embeddings. Typically, we use the last hidden state of the Encoder to represent text features. Firstly, the input sequence D is mapped to word embeddings E, which are multiplied by the input sequence D through a matrix w.
E = D * w^T (14)
Then, the word embeddings E are passed to the Encoder to obtain features S with contextual correlation information. For each different label C_j (j = 1, 2, … , k), a prompt template is used to obtain a set of sentences H_j (j = 1, 2, … , k).
H_j = M(C_j) (15)
Each sentence H_j representing a class label is input into a text encoder to obtain the feature representation of the label as follows:
L_j = Encoder_L(H_j) (16)
Then, the distances between S and L_j (j = 1, 2, … , k) are calculated, and the minimum distance is selected as the final classification probability.

Despite the excellent performance of PLMs in obtaining feature representations, certain valuable information embedded within the labels has not been fully utilized [133]. To address this limitation, several research efforts have focused on extracting semantic information from labels and employing it as a data augmentation strategy [134].

Utilizing label information for data augmentation has proven to be effective [135]. Mekala et al. [136] successfully developed a contextualized corpus using BERT for generating pseudo-labels, thereby achieving a context-based weakly supervised text classification method. Giovanni et al. [137] strategically harnessed the semantic information of labels in text and classification tasks by generating labels during the prediction process. Hu et al. [138] expanded the label space by leveraging external knowledge bases and refined this expanded label space using PLMs before applying it for prediction, significantly enhancing the performance of zero-shot and few-shot text classification tasks. Chen et al. [139] proposed a label-aware data augmentation method based on dual contrastive learning for text classification tasks. This method treats labels as enhanced samples and employs contrastive learning to discern the correlation between input samples and enhanced samples. Mueller et al. [140] introduced a label semantics-aware pre-training model that utilizes labels to improve the generalization ability and computational efficiency of few-shot text classification. Guo et al. [141] developed an autoencoder called ZeroAE, which encodes two independent spaces based on BERT encoders — namely, label-related space (for classification) and label-unrelated space — and subsequently decodes these latent spaces using GPT-2 to recover text and generate labeled text in unseen domains for encoder training.

Yang et al. [142] proposed a prototype-guided semi-supervised model that integrates a prototype anchoring comparison strategy with a prototype-guided pseudo-label strategy. Both strategies cluster similar texts, achieving a high-density distribution of analogous texts, thereby alleviating the issue of decision boundary misfit. Lee et al. [143] utilized question-answering datasets to facilitate data augmentation for text classification within the educational domain. Clarke et al. [144] introduced two pre-training strategies — implicit and explicit pre-training — to enhance the generalization capability of PLMs in text classification tasks.

### 4.2. Text classification method based on prompts
Text classification is a fundamental research area within the field of NLP. With the advent of PLMs, many research efforts have increasingly focused on leveraging these models to perform text classification tasks. The construction of text classification models utilizing PLMs has become the predominant approach, falling under the umbrella of transfer learning, which allows for the completion of text classification tasks with a limited number of samples [145]. However, due to constraints related to computational resources and the scale of PLM models, some studies have opted not to fine-tune PLMs for text classification. Instead, they have adopted zero-shot or few-shot text classification methodologies based on prompt learning.

Wang et al. [146] proposed a unified prompt tuning framework that significantly enhances the performance of BERT-style few-shot text classification by explicitly capturing prompt semantics from non-target NLP datasets. Zhang et al. [147] innovatively integrated image feature information into sentence modeling for text classification, thereby improving performance through the effective incorporation of visual features. Additionally, Zhang et al. [148] introduced a meta-learning framework that simulates a zero-shot learning scenario by utilizing existing classes alongside virtually non-existent classes, offering a novel solution for zero-shot learning. Gera et al. [149] presented a plug-and-play method that employs self-training to facilitate learning for the target task, thereby proposing a new approach to model training. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [150] developed a random text generation technique that produces high-quality contrastive samples, significantly enhancing the accuracy of zero-shot text classification and providing a fresh perspective on zero-shot learning.

Few-shot text classification involves training a model with only a small number of samples, with performance improvement achieved through prompt fine-tuning. This area has garnered considerable attention, as researchers continuously explore innovative methods to enhance classification performance in small-sample scenarios. Nishikawa et al. [151] proposed a multi-language entity bag model (Bag-of-Entities) that effectively improves zero-shot cross-language text classification performance by extending multi-language PLMs. This research introduces a new approach to cross-language text classification, addressing inherent challenges associated with such tasks. Min et al. [152] introduced a noise channel method to adjust language model prompts and update model parameters in a constrained manner, thereby achieving low-sample text classification. By accounting for the influence of noise during parameter adjustments, this method enhances the robustness and classification performance of the model. Zha et al. [153] proposed a self-supervised hierarchical task clustering method that strengthens the relationships between tasks by dynamically learning knowledge from different clusters, thereby improving interpretability. This approach offers insights into the decision-making processes of the model, enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Zhao et al. [154] introduced an explicit and implicit consistency regularization-enhanced language model that improves generalization ability through these regularization techniques, resulting in increased accuracy for few-shot text classification. Collectively, these research efforts present innovative ideas and methodologies for small-sample text classification, contributing to enhanced classification performance and generalization ability, and holding significant theoretical and practical implications.

Zhang et al. [155] proposed a prompt-based meta-learning model that achieves robust few-shot text classification by delegating the label word learning task to a base learner while assigning the template learning task to a meta-learner. Shnarch et al. [156] introduced an intermediate unsupervised classification task situated between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages to bolster model performance, thereby advancing the field of unsupervised learning in small-sample contexts. Zhao et al. [157] presented a memory-mimicking meta-learning method that improves model performance by enhancing reliance on task-adapted support sets, effectively boosting performance across various tasks. To address the issue of insufficient representation in small validation sets within low-resource settings, Choi et al. [158] proposed an early stopping method that utilizes unlabeled samples to better estimate the class distribution, thereby improving model performance on unlabeled data.

Wang et al. [159] developed a framework that amalgamates conceptual knowledge through keyword extraction based on prompts, weight allocation for each prompt keyword, and final representation within a knowledge graph embedding space for text classification in extreme zero-shot settings. Qin et al. [160] introduced a novel zero-shot text classification method that reformulates sample header text classification as a text-image matching problem, applicable via CLIP [161]. Wang et al. [162] proposed a contrastive learning framework designed to enhance zero-shot text classification performance by integrating prompt templates with tags and learning the distance between these tags and sentences. Liu et al. [163] addressed zero-shot text classification by utilizing unlabeled data and adjusting the language model, proposing a new learning objective termed first sentence prediction to bridge the gap between unlabeled data and text classification tasks. Yu et al. [164] introduced a retrieval-augmented framework for generating training data from unlabeled corpora in general domains, which can be leveraged to enhance zero-shot text classification performance. These research initiatives present innovative strategies and methodologies for zero-shot text classification, contributing to improved classification outcomes and holding substantial theoretical and practical significance.

### 5.2. Evaluation metrics
When evaluating the performance of text classification models, common evaluation metrics include accuracy (Accuracy), error rate (Error Rate), precision (Precision), recall (Recall), and F1 score (F1 Score). These evaluation metrics are calculated based on the following classification results:

TP: The number of samples correctly classified as positive samples.  
FP: The number of samples incorrectly classified as positive samples, i.e., the number of negative samples falsely reported as positive.  
TN: The number of samples correctly classified as negative samples.  
FN: The number of samples incorrectly classified as negative samples, i.e., the number of positive samples missed.

The calculation expression for accuracy is:
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / N (17)

The calculation expression for error rate is:
ErrorRate = 1 − Accuracy = (FP + FN) / N (18)

Precision reflects the proportion of samples correctly predicted and classified among all samples predicted as positive, and its calculation expression is:
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) (19)

Recall reflects the proportion of samples correctly predicted and classified among all samples actually classified as positive, and its calculation expression is:
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) (20)

Finally, F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which is used to comprehensively consider both metrics, and its calculation expression is:
F1 Score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall) (21)

Generally, when the F1 score is high, the experimental method can be considered effective. Therefore, researchers should consider these evaluation metrics when assessing the performance of text classification models to ensure accurate and reliable results.

### 5.3. Performance of commonly used PLMs on significant datasets
This study aims to conduct a comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis of the performance of various pre-trained models across multiple datasets. For this purpose, nine widely utilized pre-trained models were selected for experimentation: BART-base (abbreviated as BART) [70], BERT-base (abbreviated as BERT) [29], DeBERTa-base (abbreviated as DeBE) [173], ELECTRA-base (abbreviated as ELEC) [64], Longformer-base (abbreviated as Long) [174], MPNet (abbreviated as MP) [65], Muppet-RoBERTa-base (abbreviated as Mup) [175], RoBERTa-base (abbreviated as RoBE) [176], and XLNet-base (abbreviated as XL) [69]. In the design of the output layer for each model, a linear layer was incorporated following the final classification (CLS) token.

To ensure a fair comparison, the study employed the base versions of each model, avoiding the use of their smaller or larger variants. The input sentence length for all models was standardized to 768 tokens. Experimental parameter settings were uniformly established, with a batch size of 16, a total of 20 iterations, a test set proportion of 10%, and a learning rate set to 1e-05.

Regarding the experimental hardware configuration, adjustments were made based on the dataset size. For large datasets, such as Amazon Review.F, Amazon Review.P, 20 Newsgroups, Dbpedia, Sogou News, Yahoo Answers, Yelp Review.F, and Yelp Review.P, computations were conducted using one A100 GPU to accommodate the high video memory requirements.
