The utilization of text classification is widespread within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on the Transformer architecture have made
significant strides across various artificial intelligence tasks. Currently, text classification employing PLMs has
emerged as a prominent research focus within NLP. While several review papers examine text classification
and Transformer models, there is a notable lack of comprehensive surveys specifically addressing text
classification grounded in PLMs. To address this gap, the present survey provides an extensive overview
of text classification techniques that leverage PLMs. The primary components of this review include: (1) an
introduction, (2) a systematic examination of PLMs, (3) deep learning-based text classification methodologies,
(4) text classification approaches utilizing pre-trained models, (5) commonly used datasets and evaluation
metrics in text classification, (6) prevalent challenges and emerging trends in the field, and (7) a conclusion.
1. Introduction
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology [1–
4], text classification has emerged as a pivotal technique in a wide
range of applications [5]. Text classification is a technique that has
been widely applied in information retrieval, data mining, and Natural
Language Processing (NLP). To execute the task of text classification,
users must first define the classes and extract relevant text features to
construct an effective text classifier [6]. This process entails analyzing
and categorizing text content, subsequently assigning one or more class
labels. For instance, sentiment analysis is employed to evaluate and rate
the sentiment expressed in product or movie reviews, while topic anal-
ysis is utilized to classify the themes of texts, such as those related to
sports or education [7,8]. Text classification can be broadly categorized
into document classification and sentence classification [9], depending
on the granularity of the objects being processed [10]. Fundamentally,
the primary objective of text classification is to employ computational
tools to achieve human-level judgment capabilities, thereby enabling
the accurate identification of a given text within a specific class [11].
Owing to its extensive applications in spam classification, question
answering, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and recommen-
dation systems, text classification has rapidly emerged as a prominent
topic within the field of NLP [12–15].
The processing flow of text classification encompasses three primary
stages: text preprocessing, text feature extraction, and the construction
of classification models [16–18]. A significant challenge within this

framework is the extraction of text features while maintaining the
integrity of semantic information [19–22]. Recently, text classification
methods leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged
as the predominant approach [23–25]. The primary advantage of this
methodology lies in its ability to utilize external knowledge from PLMs,
which enhances semantic understanding and improves the accuracy of
text classification [26–28]. Among the most notable PLMs is BERT [29],
a general-purpose language model trained on extensive text corpora,
including Wikipedia. BERT’s training process involves optimization
through two key tasks: Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next
Sentence Prediction (NSP).
This survey focuses on text classification techniques that utilize
PLMs [26]. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical text classification model based
on these pre-trained models. Specifically, PLMs grounded in the Trans-
former architecture can accept one or more labeled sequences as in-
put, enabling text classification models to employ classification tokens
[𝐶 𝐿𝑆] as class feature vectors without necessitating structural modifi-
cations [30,31]. Following a straightforward linear layer, these models
can effectively accomplish text classification tasks, resulting in two
distinct classes, as depicted in Fig. 1.
Furthermore, by extracting features from PLMs and subsequently
constructing specialized classification models for downstream tasks,
researchers can leverage the general knowledge embedded within PLMs
and fine-tune these models to enhance their performance in specific

applications [32]. In recent years, a variety of text classification tech-
niques based on PLMs have emerged [33], facilitating their appli-
cation across diverse fields [34]. This proliferation of methods has
led to significant advancements in text classification research and
practical implementations, underscoring the need for a timely review
and summarization of representative techniques. Such a review will
enable researchers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the cur-
rent landscape of PLM utilization in text classification, as well as the
achievements and challenges that remain.
Numerous reviews of text classification have been conducted from
various perspectives. For instance, Bayer et al. [35] provide an ex-
tensive review of data augmentation methods in text classification,
categorizing over 100 techniques into 12 distinct groups. Liu et al. [36]
present a comprehensive overview of hierarchical multi-label text clas-
sification, while Wang et al. [17] focus on text classification methods
based on graph neural networks. Additionally, Costa et al. [37] examine
the application of embedding methods in text classification. Despite
the existence of several review papers addressing the application of
deep learning in text classification [12,17,19,35–37] and pre-trained
language models [38–42], there remains a scarcity of comprehensive
reviews that explore the combined application of these two domains.
The objective of this survey is to present a thorough summary
and analysis of the advancements and trends in utilizing PLMs for
text classification tasks. This survey builds upon existing literature
in two specific dimensions: text classification and Transformer archi-
tectures. Unlike reviews that focus on conventional machine learning
models, this survey emphasizes the application of PLMs based on
the Transformer framework. It introduces classical deep learning text
classification methods alongside those based on PLMs. This endeavor
has the potential to significantly advance the field of text classification,
given its prominence as one of the most extensively studied topics in
NLP [5,15].
This survey aims to comprehensively examine the specific design
aspects of PLMs that utilize the Transformer architecture. The discus-
sion will encompass well-known PLMs [43], such as BERT [29] and
GPT [44]. While recent surveys have explored various facets of the
Transformer, including general Transformers [38], Visual Transform-
ers [45], and Video Transformers [46], there are few comprehensive
reviews that specifically address text classification based on PLMs.
Although some surveys consider text classification [12,17,19,35–37],
their scope, classification, and coverage are often limited, failing to en-
compass the common methods for text classification that rely on PLMs.
To the best of our knowledge, no existing survey focuses exclusively
on text classification based on PLMs. Consequently, this survey will
concentrate on the intersection of PLMs and Transformers, exploring
their applications and developmental trends within the domain of text
classification.
This survey presents a thorough review of text classification tech-
niques based on PLMs. The primary features of this survey include
the following: (1) highlighting the advantages of PLMs in text fea-
ture extraction and their compatibility with diverse text classification
methods, while also elucidating the intrinsic characteristics of PLMs
from the perspective of text feature representation; (2) introducing
classical deep learning-based text classification methods that possess
the potential to significantly enhance classification performance; and
(3) examining how PLMs grounded in the Transformer architecture are
processed through self-attention mechanisms and their variants.
The survey comprises the following main sections:
(1) An introduction to the significance of text classification and the
role of PLMs in this context.
(2) A systematic review of PLMs, presenting various types and cat-
egories.
(3) An overview of the application of conventional deep learning
algorithms in text classification.
(4) A detailed exploration of how to effectively employ PLMs for text
classification tasks.

in text classification research.

cation, along with a discourse on future development trends and
research directions.

tions of this survey, while outlining potential avenues for future
research.
2. Pre-trained language model
Inspired by the success of ImageNet in the field of computer vi-
sion [47], the domain of NLP has increasingly leveraged PLMs for a
variety of tasks. The emergence of dynamic word embedding mod-
els, such as ELMo [48], has paved the way for the development of
PLMs. Furthermore, PLMs based on the Transformer framework, such
as BERT [29], have initiated a new era of fine-tuning paradigms in
NLP. Typically, the methodology for utilizing PLMs involves two pri-
mary steps: first, a general model is trained on a large dataset un-
til it achieves satisfactory performance [49,50]; second, the PLM is
fine-tuned and adapted for specific tasks using targeted datasets [51–
53]. With the rapid advancement of PLMs, they have become the
predominant approach for addressing downstream NLP tasks.
2.1. Transformer
The attention mechanism was first proposed by Mnih et al. [54]
in 2014 and was initially applied in the realm of computer vision.
The authors introduced the attention mechanism to recurrent neu-
ral networks (RNNs) for image classification, resulting in significant
performance improvements. In 2015, Bahdanau et al. [55] further
adapted the attention mechanism for NLP, employing it in machine
translation, which similarly yielded noteworthy enhancements. The
Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. [56], completely
discarded traditional network structures such as RNNs and convolu-
tional neural networks (CNNs), relying exclusively on self-attention
mechanisms [57–59]. This model can operate in parallel and effec-
tively capture long-range dependencies, rendering it a powerful tool
for various NLP tasks.
Fig. 2 shows the framework of Transformer. The Transformer model
is constructed using an encoder–decoder architecture, which consists of

two primary subnetworks: a self-attention module and a feedforward
neural network. The self-attention module employs a multi-head atten-
tion mechanism, allowing the encoder to focus on distinct segments of
the input sequence. Additionally, each subnetwork incorporates resid-
ual connections, which facilitate the retention of information across
layers. The output of the encoder is a normalized feature vector that
is subsequently processed by the decoder. The decoder comprises a
self-attention module, a fully connected feedforward network, and an
additional ‘‘encoder–decoder attention’’ module. This attention mecha-
nism is interposed between the two subnetworks, enabling the decoder
to attend to relevant portions of the encoded input sequence. Similar to
the encoder, both modules in the decoder utilize residual connections
and normalization operations to optimize information flow and miti-
gate the vanishing gradient problem. The mathematical representation
of the residual connection and normalization operations in both the
encoder and decoder can be expressed as follows:
𝑦 = 𝑙 𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁 𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑆 𝑢𝑏𝑙 𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟(𝑥) + 𝑥) (1)
where 𝑙 𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁 𝑜𝑟𝑚(⋅) denotes feature normalization operations.
The Residual Network (ResNet) [60] was developed to address the
problem of degradation, which arises from challenges during training
in deep CNN models. For a stack of layers, ResNet learns the residual
𝐹 (𝑥) = 𝐻(𝑥) − 𝑥, where 𝐻(𝑥) denotes the learned feature and 𝑥 denotes
the input. When 𝐹 (𝑥) = 0, 𝐻(𝑥) = 𝑥, indicating that residual learning is
simpler than learning raw features directly. In such cases, the stacked
layers perform solely identity mappings, and network performance
will not deteriorate. However, in practice, the residual is non-zero,
enabling the stacked layers to learn novel features based on the input
features and achieve superior performance. By introducing residual
connections, ResNet facilitates the training of extremely deep networks
and has attained better performance on a diverse range of tasks. Fig. 3
illustrates the residual learning unit.
The Transformer model employs the self-attention mechanism to
compute the output of the self-attention layer, as illustrated in Eq. (2):
𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑄, 𝐾 , 𝑉 ) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥
(
𝑄 × 𝐾 𝑇
√
𝑑𝑘
)
𝑉 (2)
Here, 𝑄, 𝐾, and 𝑉 represent the query, key, and value matrices,
respectively. The dot product of 𝑄 and 𝐾 is normalized by dividing
it by the square root of the key dimension (which is also the query
Fig. 3. Residual learning unit.
dimension), denoted as 𝑑𝑘. This normalization prevents the dot product
result from becoming excessively scattered when 𝑑𝑘 is large.
The multi-head mechanism in the self-attention layer offers multiple
expressive pathways. Rather than a single set of 𝑄, 𝐾, and 𝑉 matrices,
there are multiple sets under multi-head. The linear layer does not
feature a non-linear activation layer, and a single fully connected neural
network processes other sequence inputs in the same manner. These
network parameters are shared, reducing the number of parameters
required and improving model efficiency.
However, the structure of the self-attention mechanism lacks the
sequential information necessary to capture the order of words in a
sentence. If the order of words is altered, the features captured by the

Transformer remain unchanged, which is unsuitable for certain NLP
tasks. To address this limitation, the Transformer integrates positional
embeddings into its word embedding layer to reflect the positional
relationships between words in a text sequence [56]. This approach al-
lows the Transformer to effectively encode the order of words, thereby
enhancing its applicability to a wider range of NLP tasks.
2.2. BERT
The BERT model [29] represents one of the most influential ad-
vancements in the domain of PLMs. Through a self-supervised training
approach, BERT enables the efficient acquisition of substantial semantic
knowledge, demonstrating remarkable performance across a variety of
NLP tasks, including machine translation, text classification, and text
similarity analysis. Currently, BERT remains one of the most widely
adopted PLMs [61]. Its architecture is based on the Transformer en-
coder, constructing a bidirectional deep language model. Furthermore,
BERT integrates Masked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Pre-
diction for joint bidirectional training. During the pre-training phase,
MLM plays a pivotal role, as illustrated in Fig. 4, allowing BERT to cap-
ture and comprehend bidirectional contextual semantic information,
thereby enhancing the model’s overall performance.
In the pre-training phase of the MLM, BERT employs a random
masking strategy, wherein specific words are replaced with a desig-
nated token, [𝑀 𝐴𝑆 𝐾]. The model utilizes contextual cues to predict
these masked words, thereby capturing and understanding contex-
tual information. This training approach, referred to as self-supervised
learning, is a variant of unsupervised learning that employs supervised-
like techniques by leveraging information within the dataset itself to
create pseudo-labels.
Establishing semantic relationships between sentences is crucial for
various downstream NLP tasks. To facilitate the acquisition of semantic
connections between sentences, BERT also incorporates the NSP task
during pre-training. Fig. 5 illustrates the training methodology of the
NSP task, which involves determining whether a semantic connection
exists between two sentences. The [𝑆 𝐸 𝑃 ] token serves as a delimiter;
if a semantic connection exists between the two sentences, the output
is 1; otherwise, the output is 0.
Despite BERT’s significant achievements in NLP tasks, certain limita-
tions persist in its application. The model exhibits a slower convergence

rate during training, which may stem from inconsistencies between
its pre-training and generation processes. Consequently, BERT’s per-
formance may be suboptimal in certain natural language generation
tasks, and it may not be well-suited for document-level NLP tasks,
limiting its applicability primarily to sentence-level and paragraph-
level tasks. To address these limitations and enhance performance in
PLMs, researchers have proposed models such as AlBERT [62], which
reduces model size by sharing parameters across layers and replaces the
NSP task with the Sentence Order Prediction task, thereby improving
overall model performance.
The ERNIE model [63] represents a knowledge-enhanced semantic
representation framework that comprises two primary modules: the
lower layer and the upper layer. The lower module functions as a text
encoder, capturing fundamental vocabulary and sentence information
from the input. In contrast, the upper module serves as a knowledge
encoder, integrating knowledge information extracted from the lower
layer into the text information. ERNIE’s training methodology uni-
formly models syntactic, lexical, and semantic information present in
the training data, leveraging both MLM and NSP pre-training tasks to
extract relevant information.
ELECTRA [64] addresses the inconsistency issue observed in BERT
during the pre-training and fine-tuning stages by substituting MLM with
token detection. This approach not only enhances the computational
efficiency of the model but also improves its absolute performance.
Similarly, MPNet [65] effectively utilizes the dependencies between
predicted labels through permutation language modeling, while also
incorporating auxiliary position information as input. This enables the
model to perceive the entire sentence while minimizing the impact of
positional differences.
For models based on the Transformer framework, the input se-
quence length is directly proportional to the model’s complexity. As
the sequence length increases, the model requires a substantial amount
of memory, which can reduce computational efficiency. To address
this challenge, Dai et al. [66] proposed the Funnel Transformer, which
tapers in the sequence direction as the number of layers increases,
thereby economizing space overhead. Its training methodology is con-
gruent with that of BERT, allowing for efficient processing of longer
sequences while maintaining performance.
2.3. Transformer-XL
The standard Transformer model processes the entire sequence in
parallel, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships
between sequence elements and generating the output sequence in a

single pass. To facilitate this parallel processing, the model is restricted
to fixed-length sequence inputs. Sequences that are insufficiently long
require padding, while those that exceed the maximum length must
be truncated. To address these challenges, Al-Rfou et al. [67] pro-
posed a 64-layer Transformer decoder architecture for a character-level
language model in 2018. This model employs a ‘‘segmented training
plus sliding window inference’’ approach. While this method partially
alleviates the issue of variable-length sequence inputs, the sliding win-
dow inference technique demands substantial computational resources,
resulting in slower processing speeds.
To further overcome the limitations associated with input length,
Dai et al. [68] introduced Transformer-XL in 2018. This model en-
hances the standard Transformer by allowing for the acceptance of
arbitrary-length sequence inputs while improving training efficiency.
Transformer-XL achieves its objectives through two core mechanisms.
First, it implements a segmented recursive mechanism, which di-
vides long sequences into shorter segments for individual processing.
This approach reduces the model’s reliance on global sequence infor-
mation and minimizes computational resource consumption. Second,
Transformer-XL incorporates a relative position encoding mechanism,
which enriches the model’s capacity to learn sequence structures by
integrating relative positional information within each segment. Specif-
ically, this mechanism employs a unique embedding method to capture
the relative distances and order relationships among elements in the
input sequence, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to comprehend
complex patterns and improving its generalization capabilities. Conse-
quently, the integration of segmented recursion and relative position
encoding endows Transformer-XL with enhanced efficiency and accu-
racy in managing long sequence inputs, positioning it as a valuable
asset in the fields of NLP and other domains that involve sequence data
processing.
During the training phase, the Transformer-XL model utilizes an
additional fixed-length storage space to preserve the hidden states of
preceding segments. When processing the current segment, these stored
hidden states interact with the current input, establishing a connec-
tion between the two segments. By introducing segmented recursion
and relative position encoding, Transformer-XL effectively addresses
the critical limitation of the standard Transformer model regarding
arbitrary-length sequence inputs. The relative position encoding mech-
anism further facilitates the capture of distance information between
distinct segments, thereby enhancing the model’s comprehension of the
overall sequence structure.
XLNet [69] builds upon the Transformer-XL architecture as a pre-
training model designed to tackle the challenges associated with pro-
cessing long text sequences. XLNet inherits the pivotal mechanisms of
segmented recursion and relative position encoding from Transformer-
XL, enabling it to accept lengthy sequences as inputs while exhibiting
rapid reasoning capabilities. During the pre-training stage, XLNet is
trained on five extensive corpora, with a cumulative size exceeding
150 GB, thus providing the model with a vast amount of data. These
corpora include BooksCorpus, Wikipedia, Giga5, ClueWeb 2012-B, and
Common Crawl. Additionally, XLNet introduces a permutation lan-
guage model that leverages a permutation mechanism, synthesizing the
strengths of both autoregressive and auto-encoding language models
while mitigating their limitations. This approach allows for effective
modeling of language context dependencies. Furthermore, through the
mechanisms of segmented recursion and relative position encoding in-
herited from Transformer-XL, XLNet enhances its capability to process
long texts. Overall, the XLNet model successfully models language con-
text dependencies by employing permutation mechanisms alongside the
segmented recursion and relative position encoding of Transformer-XL,
thereby significantly improving performance in various NLP tasks.
2.4. BART
The BART model [70] employs a Transformer architecture com-
prising standard 6-layer encoders and 6-layer decoders. During the
pre-training phase, BART utilizes document recovery as its target task,
wherein the input document sequence is intentionally corrupted, and
the decoder is tasked with reconstructing the original sequence. This
‘‘destruction’’ and ‘‘restoration’’ process effectively serves to denoise the
data. To simulate real-world document noise conditions, BART incor-
porates five distinct corruption methods during pre-training: symbol
masking, symbol deletion, text filling, sentence rearrangement, and
document rotation. For fine-tuning and adapting to various down-
stream tasks, the BART model provides tailored architectures and
methodologies to accommodate different task types, including sequence
classification, token classification, sequence generation, and machine
translation.
In contrast, the T5 model [71] aspires to establish a unified frame-
work that treats a wide array of NLP tasks as text-to-text tasks. This
approach enables the execution of all NLP tasks using a consistent
model, loss function, training regimen, and decoding process, encom-
passing activities such as reading comprehension, summary generation,
and text classification. To achieve this objective, the T5 model in-
corporates several enhancements, including the removal of the Layer
Normalization bias, the relocation of Layer Normalization outside the
residual path, and the implementation of a distinct position embedding.
These modifications significantly enhance the model’s generalization
capabilities and robustness, allowing it to handle diverse NLP tasks with
greater efficacy.
2.5. GPT
Transformer Decoder-based PLMs have demonstrated exceptional
performance in language generation tasks, notably with models such
as GPT achieving remarkable results across various NLP applications.
GPT-2 capitalizes on larger datasets and model architectures for pre-
training and introduces the innovative concept of zero-shot learning,
wherein a pre-trained model can be directly applied to downstream
tasks without the need for fine-tuning. GPT-3 [44] further enhances
this framework by increasing the parameter count to 175 billion and
adopting a few-shot learning approach [72,73]. For each subtask, GPT-
3 requires only 10 to 100 training samples, and in some instances, it can
successfully complete tasks with as few as one training sample or even
none. These features significantly enhance the model’s generalization
capabilities, enabling it to effectively address a diverse range of NLP
tasks.
Moreover, InstructGPT [74], a PLM based on GPT-3, is fine-tuned
using human feedback to better align with user intent across various
tasks. This development led to the creation of ChatGPT, which is
specifically designed for reasoning and dialogue tasks. Building on
the foundational principles of InstructGPT, ChatGPT incorporates in-
structional learning during retraining. This process involves manual
evaluation of the responses generated by ChatGPT, followed by adjust-
ments to the model parameters to facilitate the generation of answers
that more closely align with human cognitive patterns. However, it
is noteworthy that ChatGPT currently lacks the capability to utilize
text classification datasets for direct fine-tuning. Researchers can only
employ ChatGPT for a limited number of text classification tasks, and
its performance in these tasks is generally inferior to that of other
fine-tuned models based on open-source PLMs [75].
GPT-4 employs the same training methodology as GPT-3 to train
ChatGPT, enabling it to handle multi-modal data. Following retraining,
ChatGPT outperforms GPT-3 in Q&A tasks. With the development of the
GPT series of models, Prompt Learning has emerged as a prominent
research area [76–78]. Prompt Learning aims to facilitate large models
in recalling the knowledge they acquired during the pre-training phase.

prompt form ´x.
́ 𝑥= 𝑓𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡(𝑥) (3)
The inclusion of prompts at the beginning or end of a sentence can
significantly influence the model’s output.
In recent years, the increasing impact of the GPT series on the
academic community has led to a continuous expansion in the scale
of various PLMs. Numerous research initiatives are actively investi-
gating the upper limits of model parameter sizes. For instance, the
Gopher model [79] comprises 280 billion parameters, the Megatron-
Turing NLG model [80] boasts 530 billion parameters, and the PaLM
Chowdhery model [81] features 540 billion parameters. The emergence
of these large-scale PLM models presents both new opportunities and
challenges within the field of NLP.
3. Text classification method based on deep learning
The automated processing of diverse textual data is a fundamental
aspect of NLP, with text classification serving as a critical task within
this domain. Traditional methods for text classification can be broadly
categorized into two groups: machine learning-based methods and deep
learning-based methods. Conventional machine learning approaches
often necessitate complex feature selection and extraction processes,
and they frequently lack the capacity for robust feature detection. This
limitation can result in suboptimal classification performance.
Early research in text classification employed various methodolo-
gies, including but not limited to support vector machines [82], naive
Bayes [83], decision trees [84], logistic regression [85], and term
frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) [86]. While these ap-
proaches were widely utilized, deep learning-based methods have
emerged as a dominant paradigm due to their superior capabilities in
feature detection and extraction, which arise from the adaptive nature
of neural networks when processing textual data.
In contrast to traditional machine learning techniques, deep
learning-based approaches leverage neural networks to automatically
extract features from raw textual data, thereby eliminating the need
for manual feature engineering. This shift has led to enhanced perfor-
mance across various text classification tasks [87,88], resulting in deep
learning methods gradually supplanting traditional machine learning
techniques in this field.
Deep learning-based methods employ deep neural networks to per-
form multi-level feature extraction and learning on textual data. These
network architectures excel at capturing complex patterns and semantic
information inherent in text [89–91]. In the context of applying deep
learning to text classification, the preprocessing step involving word
vector representation is particularly crucial. Word vector representation
is a numerical encoding technique that facilitates the representation of
textual data for computational processing.
Traditional word vector representations, such as one-hot encoding,
often fail to effectively capture the spatial relationships between differ-
ent words due to their lack of similarity information. To address this
challenge, the Google team introduced a word vector representation
tool called Word2Vec [92] in 2013. This method, trained on Google
News data, is capable of capturing distance relationships between
words more effectively, making it widely adopted in various NLP tasks.
Another prominent tool for word vector representation is GloVe [93].
The integration of these tools has become a foundational element
for NLP tasks. In most existing deep learning-based text classification
methods, CNNs or RNNs are commonly employed for classification
tasks [94,95]. However, the performance of deep learning algorithms
is heavily contingent upon the quality of input features [96]. Conse-
quently, significant research efforts have been devoted to the design
of effective features [97,98] or the learning of expressive features from
neural networks. Among these methods, Word2Vec and GloVe are often
utilized as pre-training tools for neural networks [99–101], enabling
the capture of distance relationships between features. Subsequently,
various neural network architectures are employed to extract high-level
features, forming the foundation for classification.
3.1. Text classification method based on CNNs
In 2014, Kim [10] introduced a text classification model based on
CNNs, which demonstrated promising results in various text classifica-
tion tasks, thereby validating the potential of deep learning approaches
in this domain. Deep learning-based text classification models can
be categorized into shallow neural networks [10,102], complex deep
neural networks [103], and other variations, depending on the specific
requirements of the task. When trained on substantial datasets, these
models can significantly enhance the performance of text classification
tasks. Fig. 6 illustrates a standard framework for sentence classification
utilizing CNNs.
The process of extracting features using CNNs involves two steps:
the first step is to apply convolution operations to extract higher-level
local features, and the second step is to aggregate these local features
using max pooling. This reduces the complexity of the network while
retaining the most significant and important text features. Each word in
a sample is represented as 𝑖𝑘 ∈ 𝑅𝑚, which denotes the m-dimensional
word vector of the 𝑘th word in a sentence. A sentence 𝑇 is represented
as shown in Eq. (4), where 𝑇 contains 𝑘 words.
𝑇 = 𝑖1, 𝑖2, … , 𝑖𝑘 (4)
Let 𝐰𝑛 ∈ 𝑅ℎ𝑘 represent the convolution filter used to convolve the
word vector matrix. The feature 𝑦𝑛 is the new text feature obtained
by convolving the sentence 𝑇 using the convolution filter 𝐰𝑛, as shown
in Eq. (5).
𝑦𝑛 = 𝑓 (𝐰𝑛 ⋅ 𝑇 + 𝑏) (5)
Here, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑅 is a bias term, and 𝑓 (⋅) represents an activation function.
By convolving the sentence 𝑇 with filters of different sizes, multiple
local features can be obtained, forming a set of feature maps 𝑌 as shown
in Eq. (6).
𝑌 = [𝑦1, 𝑦2, … , 𝑦𝑛] (6)
To reduce network complexity while retaining significant features, max
pooling operations are applied to the feature maps to find the maximum
value among these features, as shown in Eq. (7).
𝑧 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑌 ) (7)
The pooling feature maps form the 6th layer of the network and are
passed to the output layer using a fully connected network. After train-
ing and optimizing the network parameters, the probability distribution
of the output classes is obtained. In the output layer, a classifier is built
using a softmax function because its output represents a conditional
probability distribution, as shown in Eq. (8).
𝑠𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑗 = exp (𝑧)
∑𝐶
𝑗=1 exp (𝑦𝑗
) (8)
Here, 𝐶 represents the class, 𝑦 is the input of the fully connected layer,
which corresponds to the pooling feature maps.
The outlined process elucidates the application of CNNs for text clas-
sification, underscoring the successful implementation of deep learning
in this area. For instance, Tang et al. [104] achieved commendable
results in sentiment classification using CNNs while considering both
user preferences and overall product quality. Some researchers have
sought to incorporate word order information into shallow neural
networks to enhance classification performance [102], while others
have employed deeper neural networks for text classification. Notably,
Zhang et al. [103] proposed a nine-layer neural network featuring up to

six convolutional layers for feature extraction and three fully connected
layers, specifically designed to process characters rather than words.
The character-level CNN [103] approach extracts local text fea-
tures through the utilization of up to six convolutional layers, without
necessitating knowledge of words or any linguistic or semantic struc-
ture. This methodology has demonstrated effective performance on
large-scale text datasets. In 2016, Kim et al. [105] proposed a hybrid
method that integrates convolutional neural networks and long short-
term memory (LSTM) networks to extract character-level text features,
which can be applied to text classification tasks across multiple lan-
guages. Additionally, various research outcomes have provided novel
solutions and insights for character-level text classification tasks [106,
107].
3.2. Text classification method based on RNNs
RNNs have become widely adopted for text classification within
the realm of deep learning [108]. These models excel at extracting
relevant features by leveraging contextual information present in the
text, making them particularly effective for handling long text datasets.
Fig. 7 illustrates a typical framework for text classification based on
RNNs.
The Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) [109] rep-
resents a novel architecture that amalgamates the strengths of both
CNNs and RNNs. It employs a recurrent structure to capture contextual
information from text sequences while utilizing max pooling techniques
to aggregate essential features. The RCNN not only enhances the accu-
racy of text classification but also reduces model complexity, thereby
providing an effective solution for various text classification tasks and
underscoring the pivotal role of RCNNs in deep learning-based text
classification.
Additionally, Yang et al. [110] introduced a text classification
model that incorporates an attention mechanism, which elucidates the
significance of each text feature within the current document. This
approach has been shown to enhance the accuracy of text classification
to a notable extent. In 2017, Qin et al. [111] proposed a method
utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to tackle the implicit
text relation classification problem. Building upon this foundation, Liu
et al. [112] developed a GAN-based adversarial multi-task learning
framework aimed at addressing text classification challenges. Due to
the inherent characteristics of GANs, this framework demonstrates
strong performance in semi-supervised learning scenarios, effectively
improving the accuracy of text classification, particularly in cases
involving small sample sizes or insufficient labels [113].
Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been increasingly
applied to text classification tasks. Yao et al. [114] presented a text
classification model based on GNNs, followed by Liu et al. [115], who
proposed a tensor graph convolutional network specifically designed
for text classification. To overcome the limitations of existing GNNs
in capturing contextual information, Zhang et al. [116] introduced
a graph-based inductive text classification method. This innovative
approach constructs a separate graph document for each text instance
and employs GNNs to learn fine-grained local word representation
structures.
3.3. Text classification method based on capsule network
The concept of capsule networks was first introduced by Sabour
et al. [117] in 2017. In 2018, Wang et al. [118] proposed an innovative
method for emotion classification that integrates RNNs with capsule
networks to enhance classification accuracy. This approach capitalizes
on the robust sequence modeling capabilities of RNNs and the advanced
feature representation abilities of capsule networks, thereby offering a
promising solution for sentiment classification tasks. Fig. 8 illustrates a
typical methodology based on capsule networks for text classification.
In the capsule network, a crucial step is to implement a routing
algorithm to enable communication between two capsule layers. Specif-
ically, this is achieved by facilitating information transfer between
the PrimaryCaps layer and the DigitCaps layer to replace the fully
connected layer. The length of the DigitCaps layer (𝐿2 norm distance)
represents the probability of class existence. The routing algorithm aims
to determine an optimal coefficient 𝐴𝑖𝑗 to achieve the best information
transmission effect. Initially, the coefficient 𝐴𝑖𝑗 is set to 1
𝑘 , which
signifies that the next layer capsule is a weighted sum of each capsule
in the previous layer, with equal initial weights. The goal of the routing
algorithm is to discover the optimal weight coefficient.

Fig. 8. A typical method based on the capsule network for text classification.
Firstly, the coefficient 𝐴𝑖𝑗 is obtained through a variable 𝐵𝑖𝑗, and its
calculation process is determined by Eq. (9), where the initial value of
𝐵𝑖𝑗 is 0.
𝐴𝑖𝑗 =
𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝐵𝑖𝑗 )
∑
𝑘 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝐵𝑖𝑘) (9)
After obtaining the coefficient 𝐴𝑖𝑗, an intermediate variable 𝑠𝑗 is calcu-
lated using Eq. (10).
𝑠𝑗 =
∑
𝑖
𝐴𝑖𝑗 ⋅ 𝑊𝑖𝑗 ⋅ 𝑢𝑖 (10)
Following this, 𝑣𝑗 in the digital capsule layer is calculated using
Eq. (11).
𝑣𝑗 = 𝑠𝑗21 + 𝑠𝑗2𝑠𝑗 𝑠𝑗 (11)
Finally, the new coefficient 𝐵𝑖𝑗 is calculated using Eq. (12), completing
one routing iteration process.
𝐵𝑖𝑗 = 𝐵𝑖𝑗 + 𝑊𝑖𝑗 ⋅ 𝑢𝑖 ⋅ 𝑣𝑗 (12)
Here, 𝑊𝑖𝑗 is a fixed shared weight matrix. Typically, after about three
routing iterations, the capsule network attains optimal performance.
The final layer of the capsule network is the class layer, which
utilizes the length of the capsule to indicate the probability of each
class. The length of the output of the digital capsule layer represents
the probability of the existence of a particular class, and the coefficient
𝐴𝑖𝑗 is updated through a routing algorithm, while other parameters and
shared weight matrix 𝑊𝑖𝑗 are updated based on the loss function.
Yang et al. [119,120] investigated the capsule network model with
a dynamic routing mechanism, presenting a novel solution for text clas-
sification tasks. By incorporating this dynamic routing mechanism, the
model is better equipped to capture contextual information within the
text, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Furthermore, in 2019,
Zhao et al. [121] proposed a scalable and reliable capsule network
model that exhibits strong adaptability to various data types and tasks,
effectively supporting applications such as multi-label text classification
and intelligent question answering.
In 2019, Chen et al. [122] introduced a transfer capsule network
model that adeptly addressed the challenges associated with aspect-
level sentiment classification by applying document-level knowledge
transfer to sentiment analysis tasks. This model provided new insights
for advancements in this field. In 2020, Wu et al. [11,14,15] presented
a word-level capsule network for text classification, achieving signifi-
cant progress in the application of capsule networks to natural language
processing tasks.
4. Text classification method based on PLMs
Previous research predominantly utilized Word2Vec [92,101] or
GloVe [93] as pre-training tools for text classification. However, since
2018, word-level text classification models based on BERT have grad-
ually emerged as the dominant approach. BERT [29], a PLM devel-
oped by Google, has gained prominence due to advancements in self-
supervised learning techniques, positioning PLMs as critical tools for
visual and linguistic representation learning [123–126].
The process of employing the parameters of a PLM as initial param-
eters for related tasks is referred to as pre-training. By pre-training the
model on large-scale unlabeled datasets and subsequently fine-tuning
it on labeled data for specific tasks, the model can extract a wide array
of common features, thereby alleviating the learning burden associated
with specific tasks. Currently, fine-tuning PLMs for precise classification
in text classification tasks has become a widely adopted methodology.
4.1. Text classification method based on fine-tuning
In recent years, PLMs have demonstrated substantial potential in
text classification tasks. Notably, PLMs, particularly BERT, have been
extensively applied across various NLP tasks, owing to the rich knowl-
edge they accumulate during pre-training [127]. By constructing down-
stream task models based on PLMs as foundational models and fine-
tuning these models, researchers can fully leverage the knowledge
acquired from PLMs, thereby enhancing model performance [128,129].
Through self-supervised learning and the utilization of extensive
corpora, PLMs acquire significant knowledge during the pre-training
phase. For instance, BERT is founded on the Transformer Encoder
architecture and employs English corpus data for self-supervised train-
ing, acquiring a considerable amount of semantic knowledge through
masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks.
The construction of text classification models utilizing PLMs has
emerged as a mainstream approach. Guo et al. [34] proposed a con-
trastive learning method to derive effective representations, which
was applied to text classification based on BERT’s single-language
embedding and to Alzheimer’s disease detection.
Chen et al. [130] enhanced model interpretability by visually rep-
resenting different combinations of words and phrases within a hi-
erarchical structure, thereby detecting the influence of features at
varying levels. Croce et al. [131] introduced a semi-supervised gen-
erative adversarial network text classification method leveraging the
BERT framework, wherein unlabeled data was employed to fine-tune
the BERT architecture in a generative adversarial environment. Qin
et al. [132] presented a feature projection method based on BERT
to project neutral features for high-precision classification, thereby
improving the performance of BERT-based text classification models.
Fig. 9 illustrates the overall architecture of a text classification
method based on PLMs. This method employs two text encoders to
extract label features and text sequence features. Various pre-trained
models, such as BERT [29], can be utilized to extract text sequence
features, which are then compared to achieve classification.
Here, 𝑆 represents the text features extracted by the Encoder,
which takes the text sequence 𝐷 as input and obtains the text feature
representation through the following function:
𝑆 = 𝐸 𝑛𝑐 𝑜𝑑 𝑒𝑟𝑆
(𝐷 ∗ 𝑤𝑇 ) (13)
In the above formula, 𝑤 represents the operation of obtaining word
embeddings. Typically, we use the last hidden state of the Encoder to
represent text features. Firstly, the input sequence 𝐷 is mapped to word

embeddings 𝐸, which are multiplied by the input sequence 𝐷 through
a matrix 𝑤.
𝐸 = 𝐷 ∗ 𝑤𝑇 (14)
Then, the word embeddings 𝐸 are passed to the Encoder to obtain
features 𝑆 with contextual correlation information. For each different
label 𝐶𝑗 (𝑗 = 1, 2, … , 𝑘), a prompt template is used to obtain a set of
sentences 𝐻𝑗 (𝑗 = 1, 2, … , 𝑘).
𝐻𝑗 = 𝑀 (𝐶𝑗
) (15)
Each sentence 𝐻𝑗 representing a class label is input into a text
encoder to obtain the feature representation of the label as follows:
𝐿𝑗 = 𝐸 𝑛𝑐 𝑜𝑑 𝑒𝑟𝐿
(𝐻𝑗
) (16)
Then, the distances between 𝑆 and 𝐿𝑗 (𝑗 = 1, 2, … , 𝑘) are calcu-
lated, and the minimum distance is selected as the final classification
probability.
Despite the excellent performance of PLMs in obtaining feature rep-
resentations, certain valuable information embedded within the labels
has not been fully utilized [133]. To address this limitation, several
research efforts have focused on extracting semantic information from
labels and employing it as a data augmentation strategy [134].
Utilizing label information for data augmentation has proven to
be effective [135]. Mekala et al. [136] successfully developed a con-
textualized corpus using BERT for generating pseudo-labels, thereby
achieving a context-based weakly supervised text classification method.
Giovanni et al. [137] strategically harnessed the semantic information
of labels in text and classification tasks by generating labels during the
prediction process. Hu et al. [138] expanded the label space by lever-
aging external knowledge bases and refined this expanded label space
using PLMs before applying it for prediction, significantly enhancing
the performance of zero-shot and few-shot text classification tasks.
Chen et al. [139] proposed a label-aware data augmentation method
based on dual contrastive learning for text classification tasks. This
method treats labels as enhanced samples and employs contrastive
learning to discern the correlation between input samples and enhanced
samples. Mueller et al. [140] introduced a label semantics-aware pre-
training model that utilizes labels to improve the generalization abil-
ity and computational efficiency of few-shot text classification. Guo
et al. [141] developed an autoencoder called ZeroAE, which encodes
two independent spaces based on BERT encoders — namely, label-
related space (for classification) and label-unrelated space — and sub-
sequently decodes these latent spaces using GPT-2 to recover text and
generate labeled text in unseen domains for encoder training.
Yang et al. [142] proposed a prototype-guided semi-supervised
model that integrates a prototype anchoring comparison strategy with a
prototype-guided pseudo-label strategy. Both strategies cluster similar
texts, achieving a high-density distribution of analogous texts, thereby
alleviating the issue of decision boundary misfit. Lee et al. [143]
utilized question-answering datasets to facilitate data augmentation for
text classification within the educational domain. Clarke et al. [144]
introduced two pre-training strategies — implicit and explicit pre-
training
— to enhance the generalization capability of PLMs in text classification
tasks.
4.2. Text classification method based on prompts
Text classification is a fundamental research area within the field
of NLP. With the advent of PLMs, many research efforts have increas-
ingly focused on leveraging these models to perform text classification
tasks. The construction of text classification models utilizing PLMs
has become the predominant approach, falling under the umbrella
of transfer learning, which allows for the completion of text classi-
fication tasks with a limited number of samples [145] . However,
due to constraints related to computational resources and the scale of
PLM models, some studies have opted not to fine-tune PLMs for text
classification. Instead, they have adopted zero-shot or few-shot text
classification methodologies based on prompt learning.
Wang et al. [146] proposed a unified prompt tuning framework
that significantly enhances the performance of BERT-style few-shot text
classification by explicitly capturing prompt semantics from non-target
NLP datasets. Zhang et al. [147] innovatively integrated image fea-
ture information into sentence modeling for text classification, thereby
improving performance through the effective incorporation of visual
features. Additionally, Zhang et al. [148] introduced a meta-learning
framework that simulates a zero-shot learning scenario by utilizing
existing classes alongside virtually non-existent classes, offering a novel
solution for zero-shot learning. Gera et al. [149] presented a plug-
and-play method that employs self-training to facilitate learning for
the target task, thereby proposing a new approach to model training.
Furthermore, Zhang et al. [150] developed a random text generation
technique that produces high-quality contrastive samples, significantly
enhancing the accuracy of zero-shot text classification and providing a
fresh perspective on zero-shot learning.
Few-shot text classification involves training a model with only a
small number of samples, with performance improvement achieved
through prompt fine-tuning. This area has garnered considerable at-
tention, as researchers continuously explore innovative methods to en-
hance classification performance in small-sample scenarios. Nishikawa
et al. [151] proposed a multi-language entity bag model (Bag-of-
Entities) that effectively improves zero-shot cross-language text classi-
fication performance by extending multi-language PLMs. This research
introduces a new approach to cross-language text classification, ad-
dressing inherent challenges associated with such tasks. Min et al. [152]
introduced a noise channel method to adjust language model prompts
and update model parameters in a constrained manner, thereby achiev-
ing low-sample text classification. By accounting for the influence
of noise during parameter adjustments, this method enhances the
robustness and classification performance of the model. Zha et al. [153]
proposed a self-supervised hierarchical task clustering method that
strengthens the relationships between tasks by dynamically learning
knowledge from different clusters, thereby improving interpretability.
This approach offers insights into the decision-making processes of the
model, enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Zhao et al. [154]
introduced an explicit and implicit consistency regularization-enhanced
language model that improves generalization ability through these
regularization techniques, resulting in increased accuracy for few-shot
text classification. Collectively, these research efforts present inno-
vative ideas and methodologies for small-sample text classification,
contributing to enhanced classification performance and generalization
ability, and holding significant theoretical and practical implications.
Zhang et al. [155] proposed a prompt-based meta-learning model
that achieves robust few-shot text classification by delegating the label

word learning task to a base learner while assigning the template
learning task to a meta-learner. Shnarch et al. [156] introduced an
intermediate unsupervised classification task situated between the pre-
training and fine-tuning stages to bolster model performance, thereby
advancing the field of unsupervised learning in small-sample con-
texts. Zhao et al. [157] presented a memory-mimicking meta-learning
method that improves model performance by enhancing reliance on
task-adapted support sets, effectively boosting performance across var-
ious tasks. To address the issue of insufficient representation in small
validation sets within low-resource settings, Choi et al. [158] proposed
an early stopping method that utilizes unlabeled samples to better
estimate the class distribution, thereby improving model performance
on unlabeled data.
Wang et al. [159] developed a framework that amalgamates concep-
tual knowledge through keyword extraction based on prompts, weight
allocation for each prompt keyword, and final representation within
a knowledge graph embedding space for text classification in extreme
zero-shot settings. Qin et al. [160] introduced a novel zero-shot text
classification method that reformulates sample header text classifica-
tion as a text-image matching problem, applicable via CLIP [161].
Wang et al. [162] proposed a contrastive learning framework designed
to enhance zero-shot text classification performance by integrating
prompt templates with tags and learning the distance between these
tags and sentences. Liu et al. [163] addressed zero-shot text classifi-
cation by utilizing unlabeled data and adjusting the language model,
proposing a new learning objective termed first sentence prediction to
bridge the gap between unlabeled data and text classification tasks. Yu
et al. [164] introduced a retrieval-augmented framework for generating
training data from unlabeled corpora in general domains, which can be
leveraged to enhance zero-shot text classification performance. These
research initiatives present innovative strategies and methodologies
for zero-shot text classification, contributing to improved classification
outcomes and holding substantial theoretical and practical significance.

5.2. Evaluation metrics
When evaluating the performance of text classification models,
common evaluation metrics include accuracy (Accuracy), error rate
(Error Rate), precision (Precision), recall (Recall), and F1 score (F1
Score). These evaluation metrics are calculated based on the following
classification results:
TP: The number of samples correctly classified as positive samples.
FP: The number of samples incorrectly classified as positive samples,
i.e., the number of negative samples falsely reported as positive. TN:
The number of samples correctly classified as negative samples. FN: The
number of samples incorrectly classified as negative samples, i.e., the
number of positive samples missed. The calculation expression for
accuracy is:
𝐴𝑐 𝑐 𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐 𝑦 = 𝑇 𝑃 + 𝑇 𝑁
𝑁 (17)
The calculation expression for error rate is:
𝐸 𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 1 − 𝐴𝑐 𝑐 𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐 𝑦 = 𝐹 𝑃 + 𝐹 𝑁
𝑁 (18)
Precision reflects the proportion of samples correctly predicted and
classified among all samples predicted as positive, and its calculation
expression is:
𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑇 𝑃
𝑇 𝑃 + 𝐹 𝑃 (19)
Recall reflects the proportion of samples correctly predicted and
classified among all samples actually classified as positive, and its
calculation expression is:
𝑅𝑒𝑐 𝑎𝑙 𝑙 = 𝑇 𝑃
𝑇 𝑃 + 𝐹 𝑁 (20)
Finally, F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which
is used to comprehensively consider both metrics, and its calculation
expression is:
𝐹 1 𝑆 𝑐 𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 2𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∗ 𝑅𝑒𝑐 𝑎𝑙 𝑙
𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑅𝑒𝑐 𝑎𝑙 𝑙 (21)
Generally, when the 𝐹 1 score is high, the experimental method can
be considered effective. Generally, a high F1 score indicates an effective
experimental method. Therefore, researchers should consider these
evaluation metrics when assessing the performance of text classification
models to ensure accurate and reliable results.
5.3. Performance of commonly used PLMs on significant datasets
This study aims to conduct a comprehensive evaluation and com-
parative analysis of the performance of various pre-trained models
across multiple datasets. For this purpose, nine widely utilized pre-
trained models were selected for experimentation: BART-base (ab-
breviated as BART) [70], BERT-base (abbreviated as BERT) [29],
DeBERTa-base (abbreviated as DeBE) [173], ELECTRA-base (abbre-
viated as ELEC) [64], Longformer-base (abbreviated as Long) [174],
MPNet (abbreviated as MP) [65], Muppet-RoBERTa-base (abbreviated
as Mup) [175], RoBERTa-base (abbreviated as RoBE) [176], and XLNet-
base (abbreviated as XL) [8]. In the design of the output layer for each
model, a linear layer was incorporated following the final classification
(CLS) token.
To ensure a fair comparison, the study employed the base versions
of each model, avoiding the use of their smaller or larger variants. The
input sentence length for all models was standardized to 768 tokens.
Experimental parameter settings were uniformly established, with a
batch size of 16, a total of 20 iterations, a test set proportion of 10%,
and a learning rate set to 1e-05.
Regarding the experimental hardware configuration, adjustments
were made based on the dataset size. For large datasets, such as
Amazon Review.F, Amazon Review.P, 20 Newsgroups, Dbpedia, Sogou
News, Yahoo Answers, Yelp Review.F, and Yelp Review.P, computa-
tions were conducted using one A100 GPU to accommodate the high
video memory requirements. Conversely, for smaller datasets, including
CR, IMDB, MPQA, MR, SST1, SST2, SUBJ, and TREC, two GV100
GPU were utilized to expedite calculations. The experimental results
are summarized in Table 2, which presents the performance of each
pre-trained model across different datasets.
As illustrated in Table 2, the Muppet-RoBERTa model achieved
the highest average accuracy, attributable to its advanced pre-training
methodology that significantly enhances model performance. The XL-
Net model also demonstrated commendable performance, particularly
in processing long text sequences. In contrast, earlier models such as
BERT exhibited slightly lower accuracy, primarily due to the relatively
smaller training sample sizes utilized during their initial training phases
compared to more recent models. Overall, a positive correlation was ob-
served between model performance and scale; larger models generally
outperformed their smaller counterparts. Furthermore, an increase in
training data was found to effectively enhance model performance.

(2) Modeling Common Sense Knowledge: The integration of com-
mon sense knowledge into PLMs has the potential to enhance
model performance and generalization capabilities, particularly
in contexts where information is incomplete. Future research
should focus on effectively modeling and utilizing common sense
within the PLM framework to better align with human knowl-
edge. This exploration will facilitate the creation of text clas-
sification models that can more comprehensively capture the
nuances and complexities of human language.
(3) Multi-Task Learning and Cross-Domain Adaptation: Many
real-world text classification tasks require the simultaneous han-
dling of multiple tasks or cross-domain challenges. Future re-
search should investigate the design of effective algorithms for
multi-task learning and cross-domain adaptation, aiming to im-
prove overall performance. These algorithms should leverage
shared knowledge across tasks and domains while remaining
adaptable to the specific characteristics inherent to each task and
domain.
(4) Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning: In numerous application
scenarios, there is a pressing need to address classes that have
not been encountered previously or have only a limited num-
ber of available samples. To tackle this issue, future research
should concentrate on developing zero-shot and few-shot learn-
ing algorithms that facilitate broader applications and enhanced
performance. These algorithms should be capable of learning
from a limited number of samples and generalizing to unseen
classes, thereby reducing reliance on extensive data annota-
tion and enabling more flexible and scalable text classification
systems.
(5) Semantic Understanding and Information Extraction: Be-
yond the primary goal of classifying text, text classification
necessitates a deeper understanding of the semantic aspects of
text and the extraction of relevant information. Achieving more
comprehensive and accurate text processing involves exploring
novel approaches that integrate NLP with information extrac-
tion techniques. Future research should focus on developing
methodologies that effectively combine these two domains to
enhance the overall performance of text classification systems.
By leveraging the synergistic potential of NLP and informa-
tion extraction, researchers can pave the way for advanced
text classification models capable of comprehending underlying
semantics and extracting pertinent information with precision
and robustness.
In summary, future challenges in the field of text classification in-
clude addressing complex datasets, incorporating common sense mod-
eling, exploring multi-task learning and cross-domain adaptation, tack-
ling zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios, and advancing seman-
tic understanding and information extraction techniques. Researchers
must continue to explore and innovate to overcome these challenges
and drive the ongoing development of text classification technology.
6.2. Future trends
The field of text classification is poised for significant advancement,
characterized by several emerging trends that are likely to shape the
trajectory of research in this domain. These trends include:
(1) Model Complexity and Computational Resources: The contin-
uous advancement of computer hardware capabilities facilitates
the development of increasingly complex models capable of
processing larger datasets, thereby enhancing model accuracy.
However, this trend also necessitates greater computational re-
sources, which may prompt a shift towards more efficient models
and optimized computational strategies.
(2) Novel Models and Algorithms: Future research is expected to
focus on exploring innovative model architectures and train-
ing methodologies that integrate common sense knowledge to
improve generalization capabilities. Additionally, there will be
an emphasis on designing effective algorithms for multi-task
learning and cross-domain adaptation, as well as leveraging NLP
technologies to enhance semantic understanding.
(3) Expansion of Application Areas: Text classification technol-
ogy is progressively being deployed across diverse domains,
including recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, informa-
tion extraction, and question-answering systems. As technolog-
ical advancements continue, the scope of application for text
classification will likely expand further.
(4) Challenges in Data Annotation: Data annotation remains a
critical yet often bottlenecked step in the text classification
process due to the high costs and time commitments involved.
Future research must investigate more efficient data annota-
tion methods and explore unsupervised learning techniques to
mitigate these challenges.
(5) Privacy and Ethical Considerations: As the utilization of text
classification technology becomes more widespread, concerns
related to privacy and ethics will gain prominence. Future re-
search should prioritize the development of text classification
systems that safeguard user privacy, ensure algorithmic fairness
and transparency, and address ethical implications.
In summary, the future development trends in the field of text
classification are likely to encompass increased model complexity,
efficient algorithms, broader application areas, effective data annota-
tion strategies, and heightened attention to privacy and ethical con-
siderations. Researchers must continue to innovate and explore new
avenues of inquiry to propel the ongoing evolution of text classification
technology.
