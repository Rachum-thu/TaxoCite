Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine learning (ML) experts,
may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how ML can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster management,
we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by ML, in collaboration with other fields.
Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well as promising business opportunities.
We call on the ML community to join the global effort against climate change.

1 INTRODUCTION
The effects of climate change are increasingly visible.1 Storms, droughts, fires, and flooding have
become stronger and more frequent [239]. Global ecosystems are changing, including the natu-
ral resources and agriculture on which humanity depends. The 2018 intergovernmental report on
climate change estimated that the world will face catastrophic consequences unless globalgreen-
house gas (GHG)emissions are eliminated within 30 years [372]. Yet year after year, these emis-
sions rise.
Addressing climate change involves mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (prepar-
ing for unavoidable consequences). Both are multifaceted issues. Mitigation of GHG emissions
requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use. Adapta-
tionrequiresplanningforresilienceanddisastermanagement,givenanunderstandingofclimate
and extreme events. Such a diversity of problems can be seen as an opportunity: there are many
ways to have an impact.
In recent years,machine learning (ML)has been recognized as a broadly powerful tool for
technologicalprogress.DespitethegrowthofmovementsapplyingMLand artificialintelligence
(AI) to problems of societal and global good,2 there remains the need for a concerted effort to
identify how these tools may best be applied to tackle climate change. Many ML practitioners
wish to act, but are uncertain how. On the other side, many fields have begun actively seeking
input from the ML community.

across many fields (see Acknowledgments) in the preparation of this article.
1.1 Who is this Article Written For?
We believe that our recommendations will prove valuable to several different audiences (detailed
below). Given the wide diversity of technical areas involved, we do not assume any prior famil-
iarity with application domains (such as agriculture or electric grids) and have tried to provide
relevant keywords and background reading within each section of the article. While we use basic
terminology from ML, knowledge of the specific ML techniques we reference is not necessary to
understand any of our key points. For an overall introduction to ML, see e.g., [78].
Researchers and engineers:We identify many problems that require conceptual innovation and
can advance the field of ML, as well as being highly impactful. For example, we highlight how
climate models afford an exciting domain for interpretable ML (see Section8.1). We encourage
researchers and engineers across fields to use their expertise in solving urgent problems relevant
to society.
Entrepreneurs and investors:We identify many problems where existing ML techniques could
have a major impact without further research, and where the missing piece is deployment. We re-
alize that some of the recommendations we offer here will make valuable startups and nonprofits.
For example, we highlight techniques for providing fine-grained solar forecasts for power com-
panies (see Section2.1), tools for helping reduce personal energy consumption (see Section11.2),
and predictions for the financial impacts of climate change (see Section14). We encourage en-
trepreneurs and investors to fill what is currently a wide-open space.
Corporate leaders: We identify problems where ML can lead to massive efficiency gains if
adoptedatscalebycorporateplayers.Forexample,wehighlightmeansofoptimizingsupplychains
to reduce waste (see Section5.1) and software/hardware tools for precision agriculture (see Sec-
tion 6.2). We encourage corporate leaders to take advantage of opportunities offered by ML to
benefit both the world and the bottom line.
Local and national governments:We identify problems where ML can improve public services,
help gather data for decision-making, and guide plans for future development. For example, we
highlight intelligent transportation systems (see Section3.4), techniques for automatically assess-
ingtheenergyconsumptionofbuildingsincities(seeSection 4.2),andtoolsforimprovingdisaster
management (see Section9.4). We encourage policymakers to consider opportunitiesfor working
with ML experts and building ML capacity in relevant public sector bodies. We further encourage
public entities to release data that may be relevant to climate change mitigation and adaptation
goals. (For further policy-related recommendations on this topic, see e.g., [406].)
1.2 How to Read this Article

extremely important, these may in some cases be less pressing than those which can help

(for example,rebound effectsmay apply3) or where there is potential for undesirable side
effects (negative externalities).

Despite the length of the article, we cannot cover everything. There will certainly be many
applicationsthatwehavenotconsidered,orthatwehaveerroneouslydismissed.Welookforward
to seeing where future work leads.
1.3 A Call for Collaboration
All of the problems we highlight in this article require collaboration across fields. Collaboration
reduces the chance of failure modes such as working on a problem that is not actually impactful,
overly simplifying a complicated issue, or using advanced computational tools when simple tools
will do the job.
Collaboration is also essential to ensure that innovations will be deployed with the intended
impact. Relevant stakeholders should be involved in the full pipeline of problem scoping and de-
velopment, so that the final solution is well-tailored to the setting in which it will be used. For
example, code can be written using a language and a platform that are already popular with the
intended users, or can be integrated into an existing, widely used tool.
Werealizethatfindingpartners,aswellasrelevantresourcessuchasdata,canoftenbedifficult.
We encourage readers to visit the website that accompanies this article,www.climatechange.ai,
where we offer additional resources, as well as opportunities for knowledge-sharing and
networking.
1.4 The Broader Picture
WeemphasizethatMLisnotasilverbullet.Theapplicationswehighlightareimpactful,butnoone
solution will “fix” climate change. There are also many areas of action where ML is inapplicable,
andweomittheseentirely.Moreover,whilewefocushereonwaysinwhichMLcanhelpaddress
climatechange,MLcanalsobeappliedinwaysthatmakeclimatechangeworse.Forinstance,ML
is used widely to accelerate activities such as fossil fuel exploration and extraction [303,406,814],
while some ML models are themselves energy-intensive to train and run [69,459, 720,764].4
Finally, technology is not in itself enough to solve climate change, nor is it a replacement for
other aspects of climate action such as policy. Many technological tools useful in addressing cli-
matechangehavebeenavailableforyearsbuthaveyettobeadoptedatscalebysociety.Whilewe
hope that ML will be useful in accelerating effective strategies for climate action, humanity also
must decide to act.
3Rebound effects occur when increased efficiency results in higher demand, partially or completely negating the benefits
of efficiency gains [45]. For example, lowering the energy required to produce a product can lead to lower costs, which in
turn can increase the consumption of the product. In such cases, specific policies, such as pricing mechanisms or caps on
GHG emissions, can help to limit rebound effects. See also the literature on induced demand and the Jevons paradox.
4It is worth noting that many ML methods cited in this article require only minimal energy to train and run (e.g., can be
run on a laptop or phone).

2 ELECTRICITY SYSTEMS BY PRIYA L. DONTI
AI has been called the new electricity, given its potential to transform entire industries [591]. In-
terestingly,electricityitselfisoneoftheindustriesthatAIispoisedtotransform.Manyelectricity
systemsareawashindata,andtheindustryhasbeguntoenvisionnext-generationsystems( smart
grids) driven by AI and ML [559,623,661,814].
Electricity systems5 are responsible for about a quarter of human-caused GHG emissions each
year[370].Moreover,asbuildings,transportation,andothersectorsseektoreplaceGHG-emitting
fuels (Section3–4), demand for low-carbon electricity will grow. To reduce emissions from elec-
tricity systems, society must
•Rapidlytransitiontolow-carbon 6 electricitysources(suchassolar,wind,hydro,andnuclear)
and phase out carbon-emitting sources (such as coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels).
•Reduce GHG emissions associated with existing fossil fuel and electricity infrastructure,
since the transition to low-carbon power will not happen overnight.
•Implement these changes across all countries and contexts, as electricity systems are
everywhere.
ML can contribute on all fronts by informing the research, deployment, and operation of elec-

istry, the social sciences, and other fields.
2.1 Enabling Low-Carbon Electricity
Low-carbon electricity sources are essential to tackling climate change. These sources come in
two forms: variable and controllable. Variable sources fluctuate based on external factors; for in-
stance,solarpanelsproducepoweronlywhenthesunisshining,andwindturbinesonlywhenthe
windisblowing.Ontheotherhand,controllablesourcessuchasnuclearorgeothermalplantscan
be turned on and off (though not instantaneously7). These two types of sources affect electricity
systems differently, presenting distinct opportunities for ML techniques.
2.1.1 Variable Sources. Most electricity is delivered to consumers using a physical network
called the electric grid, where the power generated must equal the power consumed at every mo-
ment. This means that solar panels, wind turbines, and other variable electricity generators are
supportedbysomemixofnaturalgasplants,storage,orothercontrollablesourcesreadytobuffer
changesintheiroutput(e.g.,whenunexpectedcloudsblockthesunorthewindblowslessstrongly
than predicted). Today, this buffer is often provided by coal and natural gas plants run in a CO2-
emitting standby mode calledspinning reserve. In the future, this role is expected to be played by
5Throughout this section, we use the term “electricity systems” to refer to the procurement of fuels and raw materials for
electric grid components; the generation and storage of electricity; and the delivery of electricity to end-use consumers.
For primers on these topics, see [96,141,437, 817,848].
6We use the term “low-carbon” here instead of “renewable”becauseof this article’s explicitfocus on climatechange goals.

energy storage technologies such as batteries (Section3.3), pumped hydro, or power-to-gas [226];
see [27] for an overview.8 ML can both reduce emissions from today’s standby generators and
enable the transition to carbon-free systems by helping improve necessary technologies (namely
forecasting, scheduling, and control) and by helping create advanced electricity markets that ac-
commodate both variable electricity and flexible demand.
Forecasting supply and demand. High Leverage
Since variable generation and electricity demand both fluctuate, they must be forecast ahead of
time to inform real-time electricity scheduling and longer-term system planning. Better short-
term forecasts can allow system operators to reduce their reliance on polluting standby plants
andtoproactivelymanageincreasingamountsofvariablesources.Betterlong-termforecastscan
help system operators (and investors) determine where and when variable plants should be built.
8It is worth noting that in systems with many fossil fuel plants, storage may increase emissions depending on how it is
operated [47,347].

Whilemanysystemoperatorstodayusebasicforecastingtechniques,forecastswillneedtobecome
increasingly accurate, span multiple horizons in time and space, and better quantify uncertainty
to support these use cases. ML can help on all these fronts.
To date, many ML methods have been used to forecast electricity supply and demand. These
methods have employed historical data, physical model outputs, images, and even video data to
create short- to medium-term forecasts of solar power [9, 19, 161, 478, 524, 771, 818], wind power
[216, 285, 450, 512], “run-of-the-river” hydro power [623], demand [351, 429, 458, 673], or more
than one of these [402, 857] at aggregate spatial scales. These methods span various types of su-
pervisedML,fuzzylogic,andhybridphysicalmodels,andtakedifferentapproachestoquantifying
(or not quantifying) uncertainty. At a more spatially granular level, some work has attempted to
understandspecificcategoriesofdemand,forinstancebyclusteringhouseholds[ 63,421]orbydis-
aggregatingelectricitysignalsusinggametheory,optimization,regression,and/oronlinelearning
[24,409,473].
While much of this previous work has used domain-agnostic techniques, ML algorithms
of the future will need to incorporate domain-specific insights. For instance, since weather
fundamentallydrivesbothvariablegenerationandelectricitydemand,MLalgorithmsforecasting
these quantities should draw from innovations in climate modeling and weather forecasting
(Section 8) and in hybrid physics-plus-ML modeling techniques [161, 818, 822]. Such techniques
can help improve short- to medium-term forecasts, and are also necessary for ML to contribute
to longer-term (e.g., year-scale) forecasts since weather distributions shift over time [404]. In
addition to incorporating system physics, ML models should also directly optimize for system
goals [198, 220, 842]. For instance, the authors of [198] use a deep neural network to produce
demand forecasts that optimize for electricity scheduling costs rather than forecast accuracy; this
notion could be extended to produce forecasts that minimize GHG emissions. In non-automated
settings where power system control engineers (partially) determine how much power each
generator should produce, interpretable ML and automated visualization techniques could help
engineersbetterunderstandforecastsandthusimprovehowtheyschedulelow-carbongenerators.
More broadly, understanding the domain value of improved forecasts is an interesting challenge.
Forexample,previousworkhascharacterizedthebenefitsofspecificsolarforecastimprovements
in a region of the UnitedStates[523]; furtherstudyin different contexts and for different typesof
improvements could help better direct ML work in the forecasting space.
Improving scheduling and flexible demand. High Leverage
Whenbalancingelectricitysystems,systemoperatorsuseaprocesscalled schedulinganddispatch
to determine how much power every controllable generator should produce. This process is slow
and complex, as it is governed by NP-hard optimization problems such asunit commitmentand
optimalpowerflow thatmustbecoordinatedacrossmultipletimescales(fromsub-secondtodays
ahead). Further, scheduling will become even more complex as electricity systems include more
storage, variable generators, andflexible demand, since operators will need to manage even more
system components while simultaneously solving scheduling problems more quickly to account
for real-time variations in electricity production. Scheduling processes must therefore improve
significantly for operators to manage systems with a high reliance on variable sources.
ML can help improve the existing (centralized) process of scheduling and dispatch by speeding
uppowersystemoptimizationproblemsandimprovingthequalityofoptimizationsolutions[ 333,
608]. For instance, ML can be used to approximate or simplify existing optimization problems
[75, 242, 311, 871], find good starting points for optimization [52, 196, 382], identify redundant
constraints [541], learn from the actions of power system control engineers [197], or do some
combination of these [858]. Dynamic scheduling [225, 546]a n d( s a f e )reinforcement learning

(RL) could also be used to balance the electric grid in real time; in fact, some electricity system
operators have started to pilot similar methods at small, test case-based scales [520].
While many modern electricity systems are centrally coordinated, recent work has examined
how to (at least partially)decentralize scheduling and dispatch using energy storage, flexible de-
mand, low-carbon generators, and other resources connected to the electric grid. One strategy
is to explicitly design local control algorithms; for instance, recent work has controlled energy
storageand solarinverters usingsupervisedlearningtechniquestrainedonhistoricaloptimization
data [191, 192, 410, 411]. Another strategy is to let storage, demand, and generation respond to
real-timeprices9 thatreflect(forexample)howemissions-intensiveelectricitycurrentlyis.Inthis
case,MLcanhelpbothtodesignreal-timepricesandtorespondtotheseprices.Previousworkhas
used RL and dynamic programming to set real-time electricity prices [30, 90] and more broadly
for power market design [30,881]. Techniques such as (deep) RL [291,292,810,881], agent-based
models [173, 662, 663, 863], online optimization [99], and dynamic programming [704] can then
help maximize profits for decentralized storage, demand, and generation, given real-time prices.
See also [30] for an overview of deep learning techniques fordemand response. In general, much
moreworkisneededtotestandscaleexistingdecentralizedsolutions;barringdeploymentonreal
systems, platforms such as PowerTAC [638] and Grid2Op [519] can provide large-scale simulated
environments on which to perform these tests.
Accelerating materials science. High Leverage Long-term
Scientistsareworkingtodevelopnewmaterialsthatcanbetterstoreorotherwiseharnessenergy
from variable natural resources. For instance, creatingsolar fuels(synthetic fuels produced from
sunlight or solar heat) could allow us to capture solar energy when the sun is shining and then
store this energy for later use. However, the process of discovering new materials can be slow
and imprecise; the physics behind materials are not completely understood, so human experts of-
ten manually apply heuristics to understand a proposed material’s physical properties [49, 105].
ML can automate this process by combining existing heuristics with experimental data, physics,
and reasoning to apply and even extend existing physical knowledge. For instance, recent work
has used tools from ML, AI, optimization, and physics to figure out a proposed material’s crystal
structure, with the goal of accelerating materials discovery for solar fuels [49, 298, 773]. Other
workseekingtoimprovebatterystoragetechnologieshascombinedfirst-principlesphysicscalcu-
lations with support-vector regression to design conducting solids for lithium-ion batteries [257].
(AdditionalapplicationsofMLtobatteriesarediscussedinSection 3.3.)Recentworkhasalsopro-
posedtheuseofMLforscalablesimulationofelectrocatalystsforpower-to-gasapplications[ 894].
Moregenerallyinmaterialsscience,MLtechniquesincludingsupervisedlearning,activelearn-
ing, and generative models have been used to help synthesize, characterize, model, and design
materials, as described in reviews [105, 490] and more recent work [299]. As discussed in [105],
novel challenges for ML in materials science include coping with moderately sized datasets and
inferring physical principles from trained models [800]. In addition to advancing technology, ML
caninformpolicyforacceleratedmaterialsscience;forinstance,previousworkhasappliednatural

that while our focus here has been on electricity system applications, ML for accelerated science
may also have significant impacts outside electricity systems, e.g., by helping design alternatives
to cement (Section5.2) or create better CO2 sorbents (Section7.1).

and profitably as possible. Prior work has attempted to maximize electricity production by con-
trolling solar panels [1, 3, 678] or wind turbine blades [2, 833] using RL or Bayesian optimization.
Other work has used graphical models to detect faults in rooftop solar panels [377] and genetic
algorithms to optimally place wind turbines within a wind farm [188]. ML can also help control
batteries located at solar and wind farms to increase these farms’ profits, for instance by storing

MLtoforecastelectricityprices[ 460,838]orRLtocontrolbatteriesbasedoncurrentandhistorical
prices [825].
ML can also help integrate rooftop solar panels into the electric grid, particularly in the United
States and Europe. Rooftop solar panels are connected to a part of the electric grid called the
distribution grid, which traditionally did not have many sensors because it was only used to de-
liver electricity “one-way” from centralized power plants to consumers. However, rooftop solar
and otherdistributed energy resourceshave created a “two-way” flow of electricity on distribution
grids.Sincethelocationsandsizesofrooftopsolarpanelsareoftenunknowntoelectricitysystem

2.1.2 Controllable Sources. Controllable low-carbon electricity sources can help achieve cli-
mate change goals while requiring very few changes to how the electric grid is run (since today’s
fossil fuel power plants are also controllable). ML can support existing controllable technologies
while accelerating the development of new technologies such as nuclear fusion power plants.
Managing existing technologies.

and manage sites for geothermal energy, using satellite imagery and seismic data [593]. Previous
work has also usedmulti-objective optimization to place hydropower dams in a way that satisfies
bothenergyandecologicalobjectives[ 856].Finally,MLcanhelpmaintainnuclearfissionreactors
(i.e., nuclear power plants) by detecting cracks and anomalies from image and video data [129]o r
by preemptively detecting faults from high-dimensional sensor and simulation data [107]. (The
authors of [794] speculate that ML and high performance computing could also be used to help
simulate nuclear waste disposal options or even design next-generation nuclear reactors.)
Accelerating fusion science. High Leverage Long-term
Nuclear fusion reactors [577] have the potential to produce safe and carbon-free electricity using
a virtually limitless hydrogen fuel supply, but currently consume more energy than they produce
[146]. While considerable scientific and engineering research is still needed, ML can help accel-
erate this work by, e.g., guiding experimental design and monitoring physical processes; see also
[360]. Fusion reactors require intelligent experimental design because they have a large number

on previous disruption data. While many of these methods are tuned to work on individual reac-
tors, recent work has shown that deep learning may enable insights that generalize to multiple
reactors [413]. More generally, rather than simply detecting disruptions, scientists need to un-
derstand how plasma’s state evolves over time, e.g., by finding the solutions of time-dependent
magnetohydrodynamic equations [57]; speculatively, ML could help characterize this evolution
and even help steer plasma into safe states through reactor control. ML models for such fusion
applicationswouldlikelyemploya combinationofsimulated 11 andexperimentaldata,and would
need to account for the different physical characteristics, data volumes, and simulator speeds or
accuracies associated with different reactor types.
2.2 Reducing Current-System Impacts
Whileswitchingtolow-carbonelectricitysourceswillbeessential,inthemeantime,itwillalsobe
important to mitigate emissions from the electricity system as it currently stands. Some methods
for mitigating current-system impacts include cutting emissions from fossil fuels, reducing waste
from electricity delivery, and flexibly managing demand to minimize its emissions impacts.
Reducing life-cycle fossil fuel emissions. High Leverage Uncertain Impact
Reducing emissions from fossil fuels is a necessary stopgap while society transitions towards
low-carbon electricity. In particular, ML can help prevent the leakage of methane (an extremely
potentGHG) fromnaturalgas pipelinesandcompressorstations.Previousandongoingworkhas
used sensor and/or satellite data to proactively suggest pipeline maintenance [213, 898] or detect
existing leaks [81, 749, 823, 826], and there is a great deal of opportunity in this space to improve
and scale existing strategies. In addition to leak detection, ML can help reduce emissions from
freight transportation of solid fuels (Section 3), identify and manage storage sites for CO2
sequestered from power plant flue gas (Section7.2), and optimize power plant parameters to
reduce CO2 emissions. In all these cases, projects should be pursued with great care so as not to
impede or prolong the transition to a low-carbon electricity system; ideally, projects should be
preceded by system impact analyses to ensure that they will indeed decrease GHG emissions.
Reducing system waste.
As electricity gets transported from generators to consumers, some of it gets lost as resistive
heat on electricity lines. While some of these losses are unavoidable, others can be significantly
mitigatedtoreducewasteandemissions.MLcanhelppreventavoidablelossesthroughpredictive
maintenance, e.g., by suggesting proactive electricity grid upgrades (see also Sections5.3and9.2).
Priorworkhasperformedpredictivemaintenanceusing longshort-termmemory(LSTM) [76],

Modeling emissions.
Flexibly managing household, commercial, industrial, andelectric vehicle (EV)demand (as well
as energy storage) can help minimize electricity-based emissions (Sections3,4,5,a n d11), but do-
ingsoinvolvesunderstandingwhattheemissionsontheelectricgridactuallyareatanymoment.
Specifically,marginal emissions factorscapture the emissions effects of small changes in demand
atanygiventime.Toinformconsumersaboutmarginalemissionsfactors,initiativessuchasWatt-
Time [832] and the electricityMap project [789] have used ML and regression-based techniques
to forecast marginal emissions based on electricity and weather data. Recent work has also used
MLfortrendextractionandfeatureselectionwithinmarginalemissionsforecastingmodels[ 476].
Great Britain’s National Grid ESO uses ensemble models to forecastaverage emissions factors,
which measure the aggregate emissions intensity of all power plants [576]. There is still much
room to improve the performance of these methods, as well as to forecast related quantities such
aselectricitycurtailments(i.e.,thewastingofusuallylow-carbonelectricityforgridbalancingpur-
poses). As most existing methods produce point estimates, it would also be important to quantify
the uncertainty of these estimates to ensure that load-shifting techniques indeed decrease (rather
than increase) emissions.
2.3 Ensuring Global Impact
Much of the discussion around electricity systems often focuses on settings such as the United
States with near universal electricity access and relatively abundant data. However, many places

electricity system insights from high-data to low-data contexts.
Improving clean energy access.
Improving access to clean electricity can address climate change while simultaneously improving
social and economic development [430, 431]. Specifically, clean electricity provided via electric
grids, microgrids, or off-grid methods can displace diesel generators, wood-burning stoves, and
other carbon-emitting energy sources. Figuring out what clean electrification methods are best
for different areas can require intensive, on-the-ground surveying work, but ML can help provide
inputtothisprocessinascalablemanner.Forinstance,previousworkhasusedimageprocessing,
clustering, and optimization techniques on satellite imagery to inform electrification initiatives
[219].MLcanalsohelpoperateruralmicrogridsthroughaccurateforecastsofdemandandpower
production [120, 601] as well as tailored optimization and control schemes [493], since small
microgrids are even harder to balance than country-scale electric grids. Generating data to aid
energy access policy and better managing energy access strategies are therefore two areas in
which ML may have promising applications.
Approaching low-data settings. High Leverage
WhileMLmethodshaveoftenbeenappliedtogridswithwidespreadsensors,systemoperatorsin
manycountriesdonotcollectorsharesystemdata.Althoughthesedataavailabilitypracticesmay
evolve, it may meanwhile be beneficial to use ML techniques such as transfer learning to trans-
late insights from high-data to low-data settings (especially since all electric grids share the same
underlying system physics). Developing data-efficient ML techniques will likely also be useful in
low-datasettings;forinstance,in[ 680],theauthorsenforcephysicalorotherdomain-specificcon-
straints on weakly supervised ML models, allowing these models to learn from very little labeled
data.
ML can also help generate information within low-data settings. For instance, recent work has
estimated the layout of electricity grids in regions where they are not explicitly mapped, using

Otherrecentworkhasmodeledelectricityconsumptionusingregression-basedtechniquesoncel-

electric grid sensors. Although low-data settings are generally underexplored by the ML commu-
nity, electricity systems research in these settings presents opportunities for both innovative ML
and climate change mitigation.

Interpretable ML may also enable practitioners to better understand, apply, and audit models in

goals [198, 220, 842], or otherwise incorporate or scale existing domain knowledge. Finally, since

3 TRANSPORTATION BY LYNN H. KAACK
Transportation systems form a complex web that is fundamental to an active and prosperous so-
ciety.Globally,thetransportationsectoraccountsforaboutaquarterofenergy-relatedCO 2 emis-
sions [372]. In contrast to the electricity sector, however, transportation has not made significant
progresstoloweritsCO 2 emissions[154]andmuchofthesectorisregardedashardtodecarbonize

constrains low-carbon alternatives, and because transport policies directly impact end-users and
are thus more likely to be controversial.
PassengerandfreighttransportationareeachresponsibleforabouthalfoftransportGHGemis-

GHG emissions13 from transportation consist of [712]:
•reducing transport activity;
•improving vehicle efficiency;

Each of these mitigation strategies offers opportunities for ML (Figure2). While many of us

strong public policies. While we do not cover all ML applications in the transportation sector, we
aim to include those areas that can conceivably reduce GHG emissions.
3.1 Reducing Transport Activity
Acolossalamountoftransportoccurseachdayacrosstheworld,butmuchofthismileageoccurs
inefficiently, resulting in needless GHG emissions. With the help of ML, the number of vehicle-
miles traveled can be reduced by making long trips less necessary, increasing loading, and opti-

see for example [873].
Understanding transportation data.
Manyareasoftransportationlackdata,anddecision-makersoftendesigninfrastructureandpolicy
with uncertain information. In recent years, new types of sensors have become available, and ML
can turn this raw data into useful information. Traditionally, traffic is monitored with ground-
based counters that are installed on selected roads. A variety of technologies are used, such as

inductiveloopdetectorsorpneumatictubes.Trafficissometimesmonitoredwithvideosystems,in
particularwhencountingpedestriansandcyclists,whichcanbeautomatedwithcomputervision
[870]. Since counts on most roads are often available only over short time frames, these roads are
modeled by looking at known traffic patterns for similar roads. ML methods, such as SVMs and
neural networks, have made it easier to classify roads with similar traffic patterns [270, 454, 796].
As ground-based counters require costly installation and maintenance, many countries do not
have such systems. Vehicles can also be detected in high-resolution satellite images with high
accuracy [177,390,566,747], and image counts can serve to estimate average vehicle traffic [405].
Similarly, ML methods can help with imputing missing data for precise bottom-up estimation of
GHG emissions [583] and they are also applied in simulation models of vehicle emissions [46].
Modeling demand. High Leverage
Modelingdemandandplanningnewinfrastructurecansignificantlyshapehowlongtripsareand
whichtransportmodesarechosenbypassengersandshippers—forexample,discouragingsprawl
and creating new transportation links can both reduce GHG emissions. ML can provide informa-
tion about mobility patterns, which is directly necessary for agent-based travel demand models,
one of the main transport planning tools [864]. For example, ML makes it possible to estimate
origin-destinationdemandfromtrafficcounts[ 504],anditoffersnewmethodsforspatio-temporal
road traffic forecasting—which do not always outperform other statistical methods [223] but may
transfer well between areas [776]. Also, short-term forecasting of public transit ridership can im-
prove with ML; see for example [158, 586]. ML is particularly relevant for deducing information
from novel data—for example, learning about the behavior of public transit users from smart card
data [280, 515]. Also, mobile phone sensors provide new means to understand personal travel de-
mand and the urban topology, such as walking route choices [795]. Similarly, ML-based modeling
of demand can help mitigate climate change by improving operational efficiency of modes that
emit significant CO2, such as aviation. ML can help predict runway demand and aircraft taxi time

Shared mobility. Uncertain Impact
Inthepassengersector,sharedmobility(suchason-demandrideservicesorvehicle-sharing 14),is
undoubtedly disrupting the way people travel and think about vehicle ownership, and ML plays
an integral part in running and optimizing these services (e.g., [768, 837] ) .H o w e v e r ,i ti sl a r g e l y
unclear what the impact of this development will be on GHG emissions. For example, shared cars
can actually cause more people to travel by car, as opposed to using public transportation. Simi-
larly, on-demand taxi services add mileage when traveling without a customer, possibly negating
any GHG emission savings [765]. On the other hand, shared mobility can lead to higher utiliza-
tion of each vehicle, which means a more efficient use of materials [341]. The use of newer and
more efficient vehicles, ideally electric ones, could increase with vehicle-sharing concepts, reduc-
ing GHG emissions. Some of the issues raised above could also perhaps be overcome by making
taxis autonomous. Such vehicles also might integrate better with public transportation, and offer
new concepts for pooled rides, which substantially reduce the emissions per person-mile.

shared transportation—as a path where ML can make a contribution to shaping future mobility.
See also Section3.2f o rm o r eo nA V s .
When designing and promoting new mobility services, it is important that industry and public
policy prioritize lowering GHG emissions. Misaligned incentives in the early stages of technolog-
ical development could result in the lock-in to a service with high GHG emissions [36,44].
Freight routing and consolidation. High Leverage
Bundling shipments together, which is referred to as freight consolidation, dramatically reduces
the number of trips (and therefore the GHG emissions). The same is true for changing routing
so that trucks do not have to return empty. As rail and water modes require much larger loads
thantrucks,consolidationalsoenablesshipmentstousethesemodesforpartofthejourney[ 407].
Freightconsolidationandroutingdecisionsareoftentakenbythird-party logisticsserviceproviders
and other freight forwarders, such as in the less-than-truckload market, which deals with ship-
ments of smaller sizes. ML offers opportunities to optimize this complex interaction of shipment
sizes, modes, origin-destination pairs, and service requirements. Many problem settings are ad-
dressedwithmethodsfromthefieldofoperationsresearch.ThereisevidencethatMLcanimprove

and common shipping destinations. Proposed planning approaches include designing allocation

transport by producing lighter goods and enabling production closer to the consumer [407]. ML

munication [733]. If passenger trips are replaced by telepresence, travel demand can be reduced,
as has been shown for example in public agencies [34] and for scientific teams [518]. However, it
is uncertain to what extent virtual meetings replace physical travel, or if they may actually give
rise to more face-to-face meetings [762].

Therearemanywaystoreducetheenergyavehicleuses—suchasmoreefficientengines,improved
aerodynamics, hybrid electric engines, and reducing the vehicle’s weight or tire resistance. These
different strategies require a broad range of engineering techniques, many of which can benefit
from ML. For example, ML is applied in advanced combustion engine design [384]. Hybrid EVs,
whicharemoreefficientthancombustionenginesalone,relyonpowermanagementmethodsthat
c a nb ei m p r o v e dw i t hM L[15]. Aerodynamic efficiency improvements need turbulence modeling
that is often computationally intensive and relies heavily on ML-based surrogate models [865].
Aerodynamic improvements can not only be made by vehicle design but also by rearranging load.
Lai et al. [461] use computer vision to detect aerodynamically inefficient loading on freight trains.
AM (3-D printing) can produce lighter parts in vehicles, such as road vehicles and aircraft, that
reduce energy consumption [341, 407]. ML is applied to improve those processes, for example
through failure detection [722, 730] or material design [309].
Autonomous vehicles. Uncertain Impact
ML is essential in the development of AVs, including in such basic tasks as following the road
and detecting obstacles [87].15 While AVs could reduce energy consumption—for example, by re-
ducing traffic congestion and inducing efficiency through eco-driving—it is also possible that AVs
will lead to an increase in overall road traffic that nullifies efficiency gains. (For an overview of
possible energy impacts of AVs, see [95, 820], and for broader impacts on mobility, see [327].)
Two advantages of AVs in the freight sector promise to cut GHG emissions: First, small AVs, such
as delivery robots and drones, could reduce the energy consumption of last-mile delivery [758],
though they come with regulatory challenges [517]. Second, trucks can reduce energy consump-
tion byplatooning (driving very close together to reduce air resistance), thereby alleviating some
ofthechallengesthatcomewithelectrifyinglong-distanceroadfreight[ 318].Platooningrelieson
autonomous driving and communication technologies that allow vehicles to brake and accelerate
simultaneously.
MLcanhelptodevelopAVtechnologiesspecificallyaimedatreducingenergyconsumption.For
example, Wu et al. [851, 852] develop AV controllers based on RL to smooth out traffic involving
non-AVs. Their studies of emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy environments aim to under-
stand the impact that varying shares of AVs can have on potentially reducing congestion-related
energy consumption ML methods can also help to understand driving practices that are more en-
ergy efficient. For example, Jiménez et al. [392] use data from smart phone sensors to identify
driving behavior that leads to higher energy consumption in EVs.
3.3 Alternative Fuels and Electrification
Electric vehicles. High Leverage
EV technologies—using batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, or electrified roads and railways—are re-
garded as a primary means to decarbonize transport. EVs can have very low GHG emissions—
depending, of course, on the carbon intensity of the electricity. ML is vital for a range of different
problemsrelatedtoEVs.Rigasetal.[ 684]detailmethodsbywhichMLcanimprovechargeschedul-

As more people drive EVs, understanding their use patterns will become more important. Mod-
eling charging behavior will be useful for grid operators looking to predict electric load. For this
application, it is possible to analyze residential EV charging behavior from aggregate electricity
load (energy disaggregation, see also Section4.1)[ 827]. Also, in-vehicle sensors and communica-
tion data are increasingly becoming available and offer an opportunity to understand travel and
chargingbehaviorofEVowners,whichcanforexampleinformtheplacementofchargingstations

toimprovesuchvehicle-to-gridtechnology,which,likeothermechanismsforgridenergystorage
(see Section2.1.1), can help to reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation. Vehicle-to-grid
technology comes with private and social financial benefits. However, consumers are expected to
be reluctant to agree to such services, as they might not want to compromise their driving range
[343].
Finally,MLcanalsoplayaroleintheresearchanddevelopmentofbatteries,adecisivetechnol-

dation, and remaining lifetime using supervised learning techniques, fuzzy logic, and clustering

[735,819,854].Bycontrast,industrylagsbehindinMLmodeling,butreal-worldoperationaldata
are readily available. Merging these two perspectives could yield significant benefits for the field.
Alternative fuels. Long-term
Muchofthetransportationsectorishighlydependentonliquidfossilfuels.Aviation,long-distance
road transportation, and ocean shipping require fuels with high energy density and thus are not
conducive to electrification [162]. Electrofuels [98], solar fuels (Section2.1.1), biofuels [6], hydro-
gen [111, 803], and perhaps natural gas [792] offer alternatives, but the use of these fuels is con-
strainedbyfactorssuchascost,land-use,and(forhydrogenandnaturalgas)incompatibilitywith
current infrastructure [162]. Electrofuels and biofuels have the potential to serve as low-carbon
drop-in fuels that retain the properties of fossil fuels, such as high energy density, while retain-
ingcompatibilitywiththeexistingfleetofvehiclesandthecurrentfuelinfrastructure[ 407].Fuels
suchaselectrofuelsandhydrogencanbeproducedusingelectricity-intensiveprocessesandcanbe
stored at lower cost than electricity. Thus, as a form of energy storage, these fuels could provide
services to the electricity grid by enabling flexible power use and balancing variable electricity
generators (Section2.1.1). Given their relative long-term importance and early stage of develop-
ment, they present a critical opportunity to mitigate climate change. ML techniques may present
opportunities for improvement at various stages of research and development of alternative fuels
(similar to applications in Section2.1.1).

shown that supervised ML based on survey data can improve passenger mode choice models

China. There is also work on inferring people’s travel modes and destinations from social media
or various mobile phone sensors such as GPS (transportation mode detection), e.g., [156,798]. Also
in the freight sector, ML has been applied to analyze modal trade-offs, for example, by imputing
data on counterfactual mode choices [706].
Enabling low-carbon options. High Leverage
In order to incentivize more users to choose low-carbon transport modes, their costs and service
quality can be improved. Many low-carbon modes must be integrated with other modes of trans-
portation to deliver the same level of service. For example, when traveling by train, the trip to
and from the station will often be by car, taxi, bus, or bike. There are many opportunities for ML
to facilitate a better integration of modes, both in the passenger and freight sectors. ML can also
help to improve the operation of low-carbon modes, for example, by reducing the operations and
maintenance costs of rail [383] and predicting track degradation [746].
Bike sharing and electric scooter services can offer low-carbon alternatives for urban mobility
that do not require ownership and integrate well with public transportation. ML studies help to
understand how usage patterns for bike stations depend on their immediate urban surroundings
[364]. ML can also help solve the bike sharing rebalancing problem, where shared bikes accumu-
late in one location and are lacking in other locations, by improving forecasts of bike demand
and inventory [675]. Singla et al. [739] propose a pricing mechanism based on online learning
to provide monetary incentives for bike users to help rebalancing. By producing accurate travel
time estimates, ML can provide tools that help to integrate bike shares with other modes of trans-
portation[281].Manyemergingbikeandscootersharingservicesaredockless,whichmeansthat

3.5 Discussion
Decarbonizing transport is essential to a low-carbon society, and there are numerous applica-
tions where ML can make an impact. This is because transportation causes a large share of GHG
emissions, but reducing them has been slow and complex. Solutions are likely very technical, are
highlydependentonexistinginfrastructure,andrequiredetailedunderstandingofpassengers’and
freight companies’ behavior. ML can help decarbonize transportation by providing data, gaining
knowledge from data, planning, and automation. Moreover, ML is fundamental to shared mobil-
ity, AVs, EVs, and smart public transit, which, with the right incentives, can be used to enable
significant reductions in GHG emissions.
4 BUILDINGS & CITIES BY NIKOLA MILOJEVIC-DUPONT & LYNN H. KAACK
Buildingsoffersomeofthelowest-hangingfruitwhenitcomestoreducingGHGemissions.While
the energy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related emissions
[372],acombinationofeasy-to-implementfixesandstate-of-the-artstrategies 16 couldreduceemis-

[754] and simultaneously yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential
can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide—and even while extending
them to more people, as climate change will necessitate. For example, with the changing climate,
more people will need access to air conditioning in regions where deadly heat waves will become
common [553, 554].
Two major challenges are heterogeneity and inertia. Buildings vary according to age, con-
struction, usage, and ownership, so optimal strategies vary widely depending on the context. For
instance, buildings with access to cheap, low-carbon electricity may have less need for expensive
featuressuchasintelligentlightbulbs.Buildingsalsohaveverylonglifespans;thus,itisnecessary
both to create new, energy-efficient buildings, and to retrofit old buildings to be as efficient as
possible [150]. Urban planning and public policy can play a major role in reducing emissions by
providing infrastructure, financial incentives, or energy standards for buildings [536].18
ML provides critical tools for supporting both building managers and policymakers in their
efforts to reduce GHG emissions (Figure3). At the level of building management, ML can help
select strategies that are tailored to individual buildings, and can also contribute to implementing
thosestrategiesviasmart controlsystems(Section 4.1).Atthelevel ofurbanplanning,MLcan be
used to gather and make sense of data to inform policymakers (Section4.2). Finally, we consider
how ML can help cities as a whole to transition to low-carbon futures (Section4.3).
4.1 Optimizing Buildings
In designing new buildings and improving existing ones, there are numerous technologies that
can reduce GHG emissions, often saving money in the process [276, 499, 595, 754, 802]. ML can
acceleratethesestrategiesby(i)modelingdataonenergyconsumptionand(ii)optimizingenergy
use (insmart buildings).
16TheIPCCclassifiesmitigationactionsinbuildingsintofourcategories: carbonefficiency (switchingtolow-carbonfuelsor

ventilation, or other similar measures);system and infrastructure efficiency(e.g., passive house standards, urban planning,
and district cooling and heating); andservice demand reduction(behavioral and lifestyle changes) [499].
17There are even high-rise buildings, e.g., the Tower Raiffeisen-Holding NÖ-Vienna office, or large university buildings,
e.g., the Technical University also in Vienna, that achieve such performance.

Modeling building energy.
An essential step towards energy efficiency is making sense of the increasing amounts of data
produced by meters and home energy monitors (see for example [723]). This can take the form
of energy demand forecasts for specific buildings, which are useful for power companies (Sec-
tion 2.1.1) and in evaluating building design and operation strategies [20]. Traditionally, energy
demand forecasts are based on models of the physical structure of a building that are essentially
massive thermodynamics computations. ML has the potential to speed up these computations
greatly,eitherbyignoringphysicalknowledgeofthebuildingentirely[ 452,617],byincorporating
itintothecomputation[ 195],orbylearningtoapproximatethephysicalmodeltoreducetheneed
forexpensivesimulation( surrogatemodels)[274].Learninghowtotransfertheknowledgegained
from modeling one building to another can make it easier to render precise estimations of more
buildings.Forinstance,Mocanuetal.[ 544]modeledbuildingloadprofileswithRLanddeepbelief
networksusingdataoncommercialandresidentialbuildings;theythenusedapproximateRLand
transfer learning to make predictions about new buildings, enabling the transfer of knowledge
from commercial to residential buildings, and from gas- to power-heated buildings.
Within a single building, understanding which appliances drive energy use (energy disaggrega-
tion) is crucial for targeting efficiency measures, and can motivate behavioral changes. Promising
ML approaches to this problem include hidden Markov models [445], sparse coding algorithms
for structured prediction [443], harmonic analysis that picks out the “signatures” of individual
appliances [750], and deep neural networks [423].
Toverifythesuccessorfailureofenergyefficiencyinterventions,statisticalMLoffersmethods

Smart buildings. High Leverage
Intelligent control systems in buildings can decrease their carbon footprint both by reducing the
energy consumed and by providing means to integrate lower-carbon sources into the electricity
mix [277]. Specifically, ML can reduce energy usage by allowing devices and systems to adapt
to usage patterns. Further, buildings can respond to signals from the electricity grid, providing
flexibility to the grid operator and lowering costs to the consumer (Section2.1.1).
Many critical systems inside buildings can be made radically more efficient. While this is also
true for various appliances such as refrigerators and lightbulbs, we focus on the example ofheat-
ing, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)systems, both because they are notoriously in-
efficient and because they account for more than half of the energy consumed in buildings [499].
There are several promising ways to enhance HVAC operating performance, each providing sub-
stantial opportunities for using ML: forecasting what temperatures are needed throughout the
system, better control to achieve those temperatures, and fault detection. Forecasting tempera-
tures, as with modeling energy use in buildings, has traditionally been performed using detailed
physicalmodelsofthesysteminvolved;however,MLapproachessuchasdeepbeliefnetworkscan
potentially increase accuracy with less computational expense [4, 255] (see also Section5.3). For
control,Kazmietal.[ 417]useddeepRLtoachieveascalable20%reductionofenergywhilerequir-
ingonlythreesensors:airtemperature,watertemperature,andenergyuse(seealsoSection 5.3for
similarly substantial gains in datacenter cooling). Finally, ML can automate building diagnostics
and maintenance through fault-detection. For example, the energy efficiency of cooling systems
can degrade if refrigerant levels are low [435]; ML approaches are well-suited to detect faults in
thesesystems.Wangetal.[ 829]treatedHVACfault-detectionasaone-classclassificationproblem,
using only temperature readings for their predictions. Deep autoencoders can be used to simplify
information about machine operation so that deep neural networks can then more easily predict
multiple kinds of faults [387].
Many systems within buildings—such as lights and heating—can also adjust how they operate
based on whether a building or room is occupied, thereby improving both occupant comfort and
energyuse[ 614].MLcanhelpthesesystemsdynamicallyadapttochangesinoccupancypatterns
[669].Moreover,occupancydetectionitselfrepresentsanopportunityforMLalgorithms,ranging
from decision trees [193, 882] to deep neural networks [896] that take input from occupancy
sensors [193], WiFi signals [896, 897], or appliance power consumption data [882]. Energy
game-theoretic frameworks can also incentivize occupants to actively minimize their energy
demand, and ML can help here to develop tailored incentives based on different energy usage
behaviors [159].
In Section2.1.1, we discussed how using variable low-carbon energy can mean that the supply
and price of electricity vary over time. Thus, energy flexibility in buildings is increasingly useful
to schedule consumption when supply is high [683]. For this, automated demand-side response
[357]canrespondtoelectricityprices,smartmetersignals,orlearneduserpreferences[ 393].Edge
computingcanbeusedtoprocessdatafromdistributedsensorsandother InternetofThings devices,
and deep RL can then use this data to efficiently schedule energy use [489], at the level of single
or multiple buildings, or at the microgrid and grid level [631].
While smart building technologies have the capability to significantly increase efficiency, we
shouldnotethattherearepotentialdrawbacks[ 346].First,smartbuildingdevicesandconnection
networks, like wireless sensor networks, consume energy themselves. Deep neural networks
can be used to monitor and optimize such operations [39]. Second, rebound effects are likely
to happen in certain cases [45], leading to additional building energy consumption typically
ranging between 10 and 20% [671]. Third, if control systems optimize for costs, interventions

promising equity. Where energy-use data on individual buildings exist, ML can be used to derive
higher-level patterns. However, many regions of the world have almost no energy consumption
data, which can make it difficult to design targeted mitigation strategies. ML is uniquely capa-
ble of predicting energy consumption and GHG mitigation potential at scale from other types of
available data, thereby guiding policy design [536].
Modeling energy use across buildings.
Urban Building Energy Models (UBEMs)provide simplified information on the energy use of
allbuildingsacrossacity.Thesearedifferentfromindividualbuildingmodels,whichmodelenergy
use of only specific buildings, but with finer details and temporal granularity (Section4.1). While
UBEMs have yet to be adopted at scale, they are expected to become fundamental for enabling

district heating and cooling, where a central plant supplies many households in a district. In turn,
districtheatingandcoolingreducesHVACenergyconsumptionandcanprovideflexibleload[ 808],
but it needs large amounts of data at the district level for implementation and operation.
UBEMs include features such as the location, geometries, and various other attributes of
interest like building footprint, usage, material, roof type, immediate surroundings, and the like.
ML can be used to held predict energy consumption from such features. For example, Kolter
and Ferreira used Gaussian process regression to predict energy use from features such as
property class or the presence of central air conditioning [444]. Based on energy data disclosed
by residents of New York City, Kontokosta and colleagues used various ML methods to predict
the energy use of the city’s 1.1 million buildings [448], analyzed the effect of energy disclosure
on the demand [610], and developed a system for ranking buildings based on energy efficiency
[611]. Zhang et al. [879] matched residential energy consumption survey data with public use
microdata samples to estimate residential energy consumption at the neighborhood level. Using
five commonly accessible features of buildings and climate, Robinson et al. predict commercial
building energy use across large American cities [689].
Beyond energy prediction, buildings’ features can be used by ML algorithms to pinpoint which
buildings have the highest retrofit potential. Simple building characteristics and surrounding en-
vironmental factors—both potentially available at scale—can be used [83, 432].

For this, Esch et al. used highly automated learners, which make classification at such scale possi-

building footprints at a national scale [535]. Energy-relevant building attributes, such as the pres-
ence of photovoltaic panels, can also be retrieved from these images [868] (see Section2.1.1). To

even without such elevation data, as demonstrated by [77, 537], who predicted these from real

which for now are small scale, aim for complete 3D reconstruction with class labels for different

Data for smart cities. High Leverage
Increasingly, important aspects of city life come with digital information that can make the city
functioninamorecoordinatedway.Habibzadehetal.[ 319]differentiatebetween hard-sensing,i.e.,
fixed-location-dedicated sensors like traffic cameras, andsoft-sensing, for example, from mobile
devices. Hard sensing is the primary data collection paradigm in many smart city applications,
as it is adapted to precisely meet the application requirements. However, there is a growing
volume ofdatacomingfromsoftsensing,dueto thewidespreadadoptionofpersonaldeviceslike
smartphones that can provide movement data and geotagged pictures.20 Urban computing [886]
is an emerging field looking at data analytics in urban spaces, and aiming to yield insights for
data-driven policies. For example, clustering anonymized credit card payments makes it possible
to model different communities and lifestyles—of which the sustainability can be assessed [181].
Jiang et al. provides a review of urban computing from mobile phone traces [391].21 Relevant
information on the urban space can also be learned from social media activity, e.g., on Twitter, as
reviewed in [367, 703]. There are, however, numerous challenges in making sense of this wealth
of data (see [558]), and privacy considerations are of paramount importance when collecting or
working with many of these data sources.
19See [893] for a review of different sources of data and deep learning methods for processing them.
20Note that management of any such private data, even if they are anonymized, poses challenges [153].

First,citiesneedtoobtainrelevantdataonactivitiesthatdirectlyorindirectlyconsumeenergy,
and such data are often proprietary. To obtain these data, the city of Los Angeles now requires all

on urban issues related to climate change through web-scraping and text-mining, e.g., [775]. As
discussed above (Section4.2), ML can also be used to infer infrastructure data.
Second, smart city applications must transmit high volumes of data in real-time. ML is key to
preprocessing large amounts of data in large sensor networks, allowing only what is relevant to
betransmitted,insteadofalltherawdatathatisbeingcollected[ 480,672,804].Similartechniques
also help to reduce the amount of energy consumed during transmission itself [563].
Third, urban policy-making based on intelligent infrastructure faces major challenges with
data management [286]. Smart cities require the integration of multiple large and heterogeneous
sourcesofdata,forwhichMLcanbeavaluabletool,whichincludesdatamatching[ 89,190],data
fusion [885], and ensemble learning [451].
Low-emissions infrastructure.
When smart city projects are properly integrated into urban planning, they can make cities more
sustainableandfosterlow-carbonlifestyles(see[ 563,602,853]forextensivereviewsonthistopic).
Different types of infrastructure interact, meaning that planning strategies should be coordinated
to achieve mitigation goals. For instance, urban sprawl influences the energy use from transport,
aswidercitiestendtobemorecar-oriented[ 151,189,228].ML-basedanalysishasshownthatthe
development of efficient public transportation is dependent on both the extent of urban sprawl
and the local development around transportation hubs [547,737].
Cities can reduce GHG emissions by coordinating between infrastructure sectors and better
adapting services to the needs of the inhabitants. ML and AI can help, for example, to coordinate
district heating and cooling networks, solar power generation, and charging stations for EVs and
bikes[602],andcanimprovepubliclightingsystemsbyregulatinglightintensitybasedonhistor-
ical patterns of foot traffic [169]. Due to inherent variability in energy demand and supply, there
is a need for uncertainty estimation, e.g., using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods or Gaussian
processes [602].
Currently, most smart city projects for urban climate change mitigation are implemented in
wealthier regions such as the United States, China, and the European Union.22 The literature on
city-scale mitigation strategies is also strongly biased towards the Global North [466], while key
mitigation challenges are expected to arise from the Global South [570]. Infrastructure models
described in Section4.2 could be used to plan low-carbon neighborhoods without relying on ad-
vanced smart city technologies. To transfer strategies across cities, it is possible to cluster similar
citiesbasedonclimate-relevantdimensions[ 326,494].Creutzigetal.[ 151]relatedtheenergyuse
of 300 cities worldwide to historical structural factors such as fuel taxes (which have a strong im-
pact on urban sprawl). Other relevant applications include groupings of transportation systems
[326] using a latent class choice model, or of street networks [494] to identify common patterns
in urban development using hierarchical clustering.

4.4 Discussion
We have shown many different ways that ML can help to reduce GHG emissions from buildings
and cities. A central challenge in this sector is the availability of high-quality data for training
the algorithms, which rarely go beyond main cities or represent the full spectrum of building
types. Techniques for obtaining these data, however, can themselves be an important application
for ML (e.g., via computer vision algorithms to parse satellite imagery). Realizing the potential of
data-driven urban infrastructure can advance mitigation goals while improving the well-being of
citizens [50, 150,802].
5 INDUSTRY BY ANNA W ALDMAN-BROWN
Industrial production, logistics, and building materials are leading causes of difficult-to-eliminate
GHG emissions [162]. Fortunately for ML researchers, the global industrial sector spends billions
ofdollarsannuallygatheringdataonfactoriesandsupplychains[ 310]—aidedbyimprovementsin
the cost and accessibility of sensors and other data-gathering mechanisms (such as QR codes and
image recognition). The availability of large quantities of data, combined with affordable cloud-
based storage and computing, indicates that industry may be an excellent place for ML to make a
positive climate impact.
ML demonstrates considerable potential for reducing industrial GHG emissions under the fol-
lowing circumstances:
•When there is enough accessible, high-quality data around specific processes or transport
routes.
•When firms have an incentive to share their proprietary data and/or algorithms with re-
searchers and other firms.
•Whenaspectsofproductionorshippingcanbereadilyfine-tunedoradjusted,andthereare
clear objective functions.
•Whenfirms’incentivesalignwithreducingemissions(forexample,throughefficiencygains,
regulatory compliance, or high GHG prices).
Inparticular,MLcanpotentiallyreduceglobalemissions(Figure 4)byhelpingtostreamlinesupply
chains, improve production quality, predict machine breakdowns, optimize heating and cooling
systems, and prioritize the use of clean electricity over fossil fuels [74, 227, 416, 880]. However,
it is worth noting that greater efficiency may increase the production of goods and thus GHG
emissions(viareboundeffects)unlessindustrialactorshavesufficientincentivestoreduceoverall
emissions [748].
5.1 Optimizing Supply Chains
In 2006, at least two Scottish seafood firms flew hundreds of metric tons of shrimp from Scotland
to China and Thailand for peeling, then back to Scotland for sale—because they could save
on labor costs [147]. This indicates the complexity of today’s globalizedsupply chains, i.e., the
organizational processes and shipping networks that are required to bring a product from
producer to final consumer. ML can help reduce emissions in supply chains by intelligently
predicting supply and demand, identifying lower-carbon products, and optimizing shipping
routes. (For details on shipping and delivery optimization, see Section3.) However, for many of
these applications to reduce emissions, firms’ financial incentives must also align with climate
change mitigation through carbon pricing or other policy mechanisms.
Reducing overproduction. Uncertain Impact

sourceofindustrialGHGemissions,particularlyfortime-dependentgoodssuchasperishablefood
or retail goods that quickly fall out of fashion [828]. Global excess inventory in 2011 amounted
to about $8 trillion worth of goods, according to the Council of Supply Chain Management Pro-
fessionals [847]. This excess may be in part due to mis-estimation of demand, as the same or-
ganization noted that corporate sales estimates diverged from actual sales by an average of 40%
[847]. ML may be able to mitigate these issues of overproducing and/or overstocking goods by
improving demand forecasting [12, 797]. For example, the clothing industry sells an average of
only60%ofitswaresatfullprice,butsomebrandscansellupto85%duetojust-in-timemanufac-
turingandcleverintelligencenetworks[ 294].Asonlineshoppingandjust-in-timemanufacturing
become more prevalent and websites offer more product types than physical storefronts, better
demand forecasts will be needed on a regional level to efficiently distribute inventory without
letting unwanted goods travel long distances only to languish in warehouses [685]. Nonetheless,
negative side effects can be significant depending on the type of product and regional character-
istics; just-in-time manufacturing and online shopping are often responsible for enabling prod-
uct fads with shorter lifespans, in addition to smaller and faster shipments of goods (mostly by
road) that lack the energy efficiency of freight aggregation and slower shipping methods such as
rail [685,799].
Recommender systems.
Recommender systems can potentially direct consumers and purchasing firms toward climate-
friendly options, as long as one can obtain information about GHG emissions throughout the
entire life-cycle of some product. The challenge here lies in hunting down usable data on every
relevantmaterialandproductionprocessfrommetaloreextractionthroughproduction,shipping,
andeventualuseanddisposalofaproduct[ 336,674].Onemustalsoconvincecompaniestoshar e
proprietary data to help other firms learn from best practices. If these datasets can be acquired,
ML algorithms could hypothetically assist in identifying the cleanest options.
Reducing food waste. High Leverage
Globally, society loses or wastes 1.3 billion metric tons of food each year, which translates toone-
third of all food produced for human consumption [316]. In developing countries, 40% of food

casting at the point of sale (see Section5.1), as well as improving refrigeration systems [532]( s e e

Assuming future advances in materials science, ML research could potentially draw upon open
databases such as the Materials Project [380] and the UCI Machine Learning Repository [271]t o
invent new, climate-friendly materials [830]. Using semi-supervised generative models and con-
crete compression data, for example, Ge et al. proposed novel, low-emission concrete formulas
that could satisfy desired structural characteristics [271].
Climate-friendly chemicals. High Leverage Long-term
Researchers are also experimenting with supervised learning and thermal imaging systems to
rapidlyidentifypromisingcatalystsandchemicalreactions[ 140,686],asdescribedinSection 2.1.1.
Firmsareunlikelytoadoptnewmaterialsorchangeexistingpracticeswithoutfinancialincentives,
so widespread adoption might require subsidies for low-carbon alternatives or penalties for high
GHG emissions.
Ammonia production for fertilizer use relies upon natural gas to heat up and catalyze the
reaction, and accounts for around 2% of global energy consumption [551]. To develop cleaner
ammonia, chemists may be able to invent electrochemical strategies for lower-temperature
ammonia production [551, 849]. Given the potential of ML for predicting chemical reactions
[140],MLmayalsobeabletohelpwiththediscoveryofnewmaterialsforelectrocatalystsand/or

5.3 Production and Energy
ML can potentially assist in reducing overall electricity consumption, streamlining factories’
HVAC systems, and developing models for electrifying industrial processes so they can be run
on low-carbon energy instead of coal, oil, or natural gas [305]. Again, the higher the incentives
forreducingcarbonemissions,themorelikelythatfirmswilloptimizeforlow-carbonenergyuse.
Newfactoryequipmentcanbeveryexpensivetopurchaseandsetup,sofirms’cost–benefitcalcu-
lations may dissuade them from retrofitting existing factories to run using low-carbon electricity
or to save a few kilowatts [288, 633, 778]. Given the heterogeneity across industrial sectors and
the secrecy of industrial data, firms will also need to tailor the requisite sensors and data analysis
systems to their individual processes. ML will become a much more viable option for industry

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning 42:29
when factory workers can identify, develop, implement, and monitor their own solutions inter-
nally instead of relying upon outside experts [337]. The ML community can assist by building
accessible, customizable industry tools (i.e., “low-code” or “no-code” user interfaces) tailored for
people without a strong background in data science.
Adaptive control. High Leverage
On the production side, ML can potentially improve the efficiency of HVAC systems and other
industrial control mechanisms—if given necessary data about all relevant processes. To reduce
GHG emissions from HVAC systems, researchers have suggested combining optimization-based
controlalgorithmswithMLtechniquessuchasimagerecognition,regressiontrees,andtimedelay
neural networks [5, 202]( s e ea l s o4.1). DeepMind has used RL to optimize cooling centers for
Google’sinternalserversbypredictingandoptimizingthe powerusageeffectiveness ,thuslowering
HFCemissionsandreducingcoolingcosts[ 227,268].Deepneuralnetworkscouldalsobeusedfor
adaptive control in a variety of industrial networking applications [8], enabling energy savings
through self-learning about devices’ surroundings.
Predictive maintenance.
ML could also contribute to predictive maintenance (see also Sections2.2 and 9.2) by more accu-
rately modelling the wear and tear of machinery that is currently in use, and interpretable ML
could assist factory owners in developing a better understanding of how best to minimize GHG
emissionsforspecificequipmentandprocesses.Forexample,creatinga digitaltwin modelofsome

by identifying broken or about-to-break machines before the actual factory equipment starts pro-
ducing damaged products. Industrial systems can employ similar models to predict which pipes
are liable to spring leaks, thus minimizing the direct release of GHGs such as HFCs and natural
gas.
Using cleaner electricity. High Leverage
ML may be particularly useful for enabling more flexible operation of industrial electrical loads,
through optimizing a firm’sdemand responseto electricity prices (see also Section2). Such opti-
mization can contribute to cutting GHG emissions as long as firms have a financial incentive to
optimize for minimal emissions, maximal low-carbon energy, or minimum overall power usage.
Demand response optimization algorithms can help firms adjust the timing of energy-intensive
processes such as cement crushing [880] and powder-coating [43] to take advantage of electric-
ity price fluctuations, although published work on the topic has to date used relatively little ML.
Online algorithms for optimizing demand response can reduce overall power usage for computer
servers by dynamically shifting the internet traffic load of data providers to underutilized servers,
althoughmostofthisresearch,again,hasfocusedonminimizingcostsratherthanGHGemissions
[99,352].Berraletal.proposedaframeworkthatdemonstrateshowsuchoptimizationalgorithms
might be combined with RL, digitized controls, and feedback systems to enable the autonomous
control of industrial processes [74].
5.4 Discussion
Given the globalized nature of international trade and the urgency of climate change, decarboniz-
ing the industrial sector is becoming a key priority for both policymakers and factory owners

pressure from governments, financial institutions, and stockholders (see, e.g., [620, 793]). These
strategies are evolving rapidly, using ML alongside many approaches not covered here.
As we have seen, there are a number of highly impactful applications where ML can help re-
duceGHGemissionsinindustry,withseveralcaveats.First,incentivesforcleanerproductionand
distribution are not always aligned with reduced costs, though policies can play a role in aligning
these incentives. Second, despite the proliferation of industrial data, much of the information is
proprietary, low-quality, or very specific to individual machines or processes; practitioners esti-
mate that 60%–70% of collected industrial data goes unused [138, 310]. Before investing in exten-
sive ML research, researchers should be sure that they will be able to eventually access and clean
any data needed for their algorithms. Finally, misjudgments can be very costly for manufacturers
and retailers, leading most managers to adopt risk-averse strategies towards relatively untested
technologiessuchas ML[ 337]. For this reason,ML algorithms thatdetermine industrialactivities
should be robust enough to guarantee both performance and safety, along with providing both
interpretable and reproducible results [338,709].
6 FARMS & FORESTS BY ALEXANDRE LACOSTE
Plants, microbes, and other organisms have been drawing CO2 from the atmosphere for millions
of years. Most of this carbon is continually broken down and recirculated through the carbon
cycle, and some is stored deep underground, e.g., as fossil fuels, but a large amount of carbon is
sequesteredinthebiomassoftrees,peatbogs,andsoil.Ourcurrenteconomyencouragespractices

for deforestation. Satellite images make it possible to estimate the amount of carbon sequestered
in a given area of land, as well as track GHG emissions from it. ML can help monitor the health
of forests and peatlands, predict the risk of fire, and contribute to sustainable forestry (Figure5).

with decarbonization.
6.1 Remote Sensing of Emissions High Leverage
Having real-time maps of GHGs could help us quantify emissions from agriculture and forestry
practices,whichremainrelativelyuncertain[ 371],aswellasmonitoremissionsfromothersectors

Suchinformationwouldbevaluableinguidingregulationsorincentivesthatcouldleadtobetter

pinpointing the sources of emissions makes it possible to enforce regulations.
While GHGs are invisible to our eyes, they must by definition interact with sunlight. This
means that we can observe these compounds with hyperspectral cameras [428, 711]. These

cameras can record up to several hundred different wavelengths (instead of simplyred, green,
and blue [RGB]), providing information on the interaction between light and individual chemi-
cals.Manysatellitesareequippedwithsuchcamerasandcanperform,tosomeextent,estimations
ofCO2,CH4 (methane),H2O, and N2O(nitrousoxide)emissions[ 73,378].Whileextremelyuseful
for studying climate change, most of these satellites have very coarse spatial resolution and large
temporal and spatial gaps, making them unsuitable for precise tracking of emissions. Standard
satellite imagery provides RGB images with much higher resolution, which could be used in an
ML algorithm to fill the gaps in hyperspectral data and obtain more precise information about
emissions.23 Some preliminary work [378] has studied this possibility, but this remains largely an
open problem with high potential impact.
6.2 Precision Agriculture High Leverage Uncertain Impact
Crop production is a significant source of GHG emissions. This might come as a surprise, since
plants take up CO2 from the air. However, modern industrial crop production involves more than
just growing plants. First, the land is generally stripped of existing vegetation, releasing carbon
sequestered there. Second, the process of tilling exposes topsoil to the air, thereby releasing car-
bonthathadbeenboundinsoilaggregatesanddisruptingorganismsinthesoilthatcontributeto
sequestration.Finally, because such farming practices strip soil of nutrients,nitrogen-based fertil-
izers must be added back to the system. Synthesizing these fertilizers consumes massive amounts
of energy, about 2% of global energy consumption [551] (see Section5.2). Moreover, while some
of this nitrogen is absorbed by plants or retained in the soil, some is converted to nitrous oxide,24
a GHG that is about 300 times more potent than CO2.
Suchindustrialagricultureapproachesareultimatelybasedon making farmland more uniform
and predictable. This allows it to be managed at scale using basic automation tools like tractors,
but can be both more destructive and less productive than approaches that work with the natural
23Satellites with higher resolution hyperspectral cameras are beginning to deploy, including GHGSat satellites in already
orbit and plans by Carbon Mapper, Bluefield Technologies, and the Environmental Defense Fund to launch satellites in
coming years [81,113,534]. Even once this technology comes online, ML will remain useful to cover gaps and to estimate
emissions of other GHGs.
24Some fertilizer additionally often ends up in waterways, which can contaminate drinking water and induce blooms of
toxic algae [687].

heterogeneityoflandandcrops.Increasingly,thereisdemandforsophisticatedtoolswhichwould
allowfarmerstoworkatscale,butadapttowhatthelandneeds.Thisapproachisoftenknownas
“precision agriculture.”
Smarter robotic tools can help enable precision agriculture. Robots are under development, for
example, with the ability to perform mechanical weeding, targeted pesticide application, and vac-
uuming of pests [766], as well as the collection of large datasets for continual improvement [68].
Many corporate players now exist in the space of ML-aided robotics for precision agriculture
[80, 212, 742, 788]. There remains significant room for development, since many tasks remain
challengingforrobots,andfurthermoretherearealargenumberofspecifictasksandagricultural
settings to consider.
There are many additional ways in which ML can contribute to precision agriculture. Intelli-
gent irrigation systems can save large amounts of water while reducing pests that thrive under
excessive moisture [335]. ML can also help in disease detection, weed detection, and soil sensing
[482, 699, 821]. ML can guide crop yield prediction [866] and even macroeconomic models that
help farmers predict crop demand and decide what to plant at the beginning of the season [503].
Theseproblemsoftenhaveminimalhardwarerequirements,asdevicessuchas UnmannedAerial
Vehicles (UAVs)with hyperspectral cameras can be used for all of these tasks.
Globally, agriculture constitutes a $2.4 trillion industry [785], and there is already a signifi-
cant economic incentive to increaseefficiency.However, efficiencygains do not necessarilytrans-
late into reduced GHG emissions (e.g., via rebound effects increasing consumption of particularly
emissions-intensive products). Moreover, significantly reducing emissions may require a shift in
agriculturalparadigms,forexample,widespreadadoptionofregenerativeagriculture,silvopasture,
and tree intercropping [335]. ML tools for policymakers and agronomists [126] could potentially
encourageclimate-positiveaction:forexample,remotesensingwithUAVsandsatellitescouldper-
form methane detection and carbon stock estimation, which could be used to incentivize farmers
to sequester more carbon and reduce emissions.
6.3 Monitoring Peatlands High Leverage
Peatlands (a type of wetland ecosystem) cover only 3% of the Earth’s land area, yet hold twice

susceptible to fire [245, 612]. A single peat fire in Indonesia in 1997 is reported to have released
emissions comparable to 20%–50% of global fossil fuel emissions during the same year [606].
Monitoring peatlands and protecting them from artificial drainage or droughts is essential to
preservethecarbonsequesteredinthem[ 349,400].In[ 538],MLwasappliedtofeaturesextracted

cost, as well as predicting the risk of fire.
6.4 Managing Forests
Estimating carbon stock. High Leverage
Modeling(andpricing)carbonstoredinforestsrequiresustoassesshowmuchisbeingsequestered

[693], tree species and heights are a good indicator of the carbon stock.

Automating afforestation. Long-term Uncertain Impact
Planting trees, also calledafforestation, can be a means of sequestering CO2 over the long term.
According to one estimate, up to 0.9 billion hectares of extra canopy cover could theoretically be
added [60] globally. However, care must be taken when plantingtreesto ensure a positiveimpact.
Afforestationthatcomesattheexpenseoffarmland(orecosystemssuchaspeatbogs)couldresult
in a net increase of GHG emissions. Moreover, planting trees without regard for local conditions
and native species can reduce the climate impact of afforestation as well as negatively affecting
biodiversity.
MLcanbehelpfulinautomatinglarge-scaleafforestationbylocatingappropriateplantingsites,
monitoring plant health, assessing weeds, and analyzing trends. For example, startups like Den-
dra Systems and Droneseed are developing UAVs that are capable of planting seed packets more
quickly and cheaply than traditional methods [176, 204], while Restor uses ML to learn from past
afforestation projects about effective strategies for ecosystem restoration [681].
Managing forest fires.
Besides their potential for harming people and property, forest fires release CO2 into the atmo-
sphere (which in turn increases the rate of forest fires [839]). On the other hand, small forest fires
are part of natural forest cycles. Preventing them causes biomass to accumulate on the ground
andincreasesthechancesoflargefires,whichcanthenburnalltreestothegroundanderodetop
soil, resulting in high CO2 emissions, biodiversity loss, and a long recovery time [550]. Drought
forecasting [682] is helpful in predicting regions that are more at risk, as is estimating the water
content in the tree canopy [94]. In [266, 267], RL is used to predict the spatial progression of fire.
This helps firefighters decide when to let a fire burn and when to stop it [355]. With good tools
to evaluate regions that are more at risk, firefighters can perform controlled burns and cut select
areas to prevent the progression of fires.
Reducing deforestation. High Leverage
Only 17% of the world’s forests are legally protected [506]. The rest are subject to deforestation,
which contributes to approximately 10% of global GHG emissions [370] as vegetation is burned
or decays. About 80% percent of global deforestation is the result of agriculture (clearing land for
pasture or crop production), while other significant causes include mining, logging, and urban
development [353].
Tools for tracking deforestation can provide valuable data for informing policymakers, as well

remote sensing imagery to pinpoint changes in forest cover [241, 329, 369], or proxies for defor-

cutting from clearcutting [342, 487]. ML can also be used with audio instead of visual data; one
such project installs (old) smartphones powered by solar panels in the forest, which enables the
detection of chainsaw sounds within a one-kilometer radius [657].

thereby providing verification of carbon credits or other incentive structures for land custodians

Interfacing between these different stakeholders is a practical challenge for meaningful work in
this area.
7 CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL BY ANDREW S. ROSS & EV AN D. SHERWIN
Evenifwecouldcutemissionstozerotoday,wewouldstillfacesignificantclimateconsequences
from GHGs already in the atmosphere. Eliminating emissions entirely may also be tricky, given
the sheer diversity of sources (such as airplanes and cows). Instead, many experts argue that to
meet critical climate goals, global emissions must become net-negative—that is, we must remove
more CO2 from the atmosphere than we release [259, 269]. Although there has been significant
progress in negative emissions research [260,540,575,580,707], the actual CO2 removal industry
is still in its infancy. As such, many of the ML applications we outline in this section are either
speculative or in the early stages of development or commercialization.
Many of the primary candidate technologies for CO2 removal directly harness the same nat-
ural processes which have (pre-)historically shaped our atmosphere. One of the most promising
methods is simply allowing or encouraging more natural uptake of CO2 by plants (whose ML
applications we discuss in Section6). Other plant-based methods include bioenergy with carbon
capture andbiochar, where plants are grown specifically to absorb CO2 and then burned in a way
thatsequestersit(whilecreatingenergyorfertilizerasausefulbyproduct)[ 155,575,690].Finally,
thewaymostofEarth’sCO 2 hasbeenremovedovergeologictimescalesistheslowprocessofmin-

[718]. These processes can both be massively accelerated by human activity to achieve necessary

are all promising enough as techniques to merit mention, they may have drawbacks in terms of
landuseandpotentiallyseriousenvironmentalimpacts,and(morerelevantlyforthisarticle)they
would not likely benefit significantly from ML.
7.1 Direct Air Capture Long-term
Another approach is to build facilities to extract CO2 from power plant exhaust, industrial pro-
cesses, or even ambient air [701]. While thisdirect air capture (DAC)approach faces technical
hurdles,itrequireslittlelandandhas,accordingtocurrentunderstanding,minimalnegativeenvi-
ronmental impacts [152]. The basic idea behind DAC is to blow air onto CO2 sorbents (essentially
like sponges, but for gas), which are either solid or in solution, then use heat-powered chemical

OnceCO2 iscaptured,itmustbesequesteredorstored,securelyandatscale,topreventre-release

8.1 Uniting Data, ML, and Climate Science
Climate models represent our understanding of Earth and climate physics. We can learn about
the Earth by collecting data. To turn that data into useful predictions, we need to condense it
intocoherent,computationallytractablemodels.MLmodelsarelikelytobemoreaccurateorless

Numerous authors, such as [287], have identified geoscience problems that would be aided by
the development ofbenchmarkdatasets.Effortsto develop suchdatasetsinclude EnviroNet[ 565],
the IS-GEO benchmark datasets [211], and ExtremeWeather [652]. We expect the collection of
curated geoscience datasets to continue to grow; this process might even be accelerated by ML
optimizations in data collection systems [287]. We strongly encourage modellers to dive into the
data in collaboration with domain experts. We also recommend that modellers who seek to learn
directly from data see [354] for specific advice on fitting and over-fitting climate data.

[371, 729]. These effects are controlled by small-scale processes such as cloud convection and
atmospheric aerosols (see uses of aerosols for cloud seeding and solar geoengineering in Section
10). Physical models of these processes are far too computationally expensive to include in global
climate models—but ML models are not. Gentine et al. trained a deep neural network to emulate
the behavior of a high-resolution cloud simulation, and found that the network gave similar
results for a fraction of the cost [275] and was stable in a simplified global model [670]. Existing
scientific model structuresdo not always offer great trade-offs between cost and accuracy. Neural
networks trained on those scientific models produce similar predictions, but offer an entirely
new set of compromises between training cost, production cost, and accuracy. Replacing select
climate model components with neural network approximators may thus improve both the cost
and the accuracy of global climate models. Additional work is needed to identify more climate
model components that could be replaced by neural networks (we highlight other impactful
components below), to optimize those models, and to automate their training workflows (see
examples in [676]).
Ice sheets and sea level rise. High Leverage
The next most important targets for climate model improvements are ice sheet dynamics and sea
level rise. The Arctic and Antarctic are warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, and their
climates control the future of global sea level rise and many vulnerable ecosystems [370, 372].
Unfortunately, these regions are dark and cold, and until recently they were difficult to observe.
In the past few years, however, new satellite campaigns have illuminated them with hundreds

of terabytes of data.28 These data could make it possible to use ML to solve some of the field’s
biggest outstanding questions. In particular, models of mass loss from the Antarctic ice-sheet are
highlyuncertain[ 449]andmodelsoftheextentofAntarcticseaicedonotmatchrealitywell[ 263].
The most uncertain parts of these models, and thus the best targets for improvement, are snow
reflectivity, sea ice reflectivity, ocean heat mixing, and ice sheet grounding line migration rates
[328, 354, 449]. Computer scientists who wish to work in this area could build models that learn
snow and sea ice properties from satellite data, or use new video prediction techniques to predict
short-term changes in the sea ice extent.
8.1.3 Working with Climate Models. ML could also be used to identify and leverage relation-
ships between climate variables. Pattern recognition and feature extraction techniques could al-
low us to identify more useful connections in the climate system, and regression models could
allow us to quantify non-linear relationships between connected variables. For example, Nowack
et al. demonstrated that ozone concentrations could be computed as a function of temperature,
rather than physical transport laws, which led to considerable computational savings [587].
The best climate predictions are synthesizedfrom ensembles of 20+ climate models [782]. Mak-
inggoodensemblepredictionsisanexcellentMLproblem.Monteleonietal.proposedthatonline
ML algorithms could create better predictions of one or more target variables in a multi-model
ensemble of climate models [549]; this idea has been refined in [530, 763]. More recently, Ander-
son and Lucas used random forests to make high-resolution predictions from a mix of high- and
low-resolution models, which could reduce the costs of building multi-model ensembles [23].
In the further future, the Climate Modeling Alliance has proposed to build an entirely new

8.2 Forecasting Extreme Events
For most people, extreme event prediction means the local weather forecast and a few days’
warning to stockpile food, go home, and lock the shutters. Weather forecasts are shorter-term
thanclimateforecasts,buttheyproduceabundantdata.Weathermodelsareoptimizedtotrackthe
rapid, chaotic changes of the atmosphere; since these changes are fast, tomorrow’s weather fore-
castismadeandtestedeveryday.Climatemodels,incontrast,arechaoticonshorttimescales,but
theirlong-termtrendsaredrivenbyslow,predictablechangesofocean,land,andice(see[ 734]).29
As a result, climate model output can only be tested against long-term observations (at the scale
of years to decades). Intermediate time scales, of weeks to months, are exceptionally difficult to
predict, although Cohen et al. [139] argue that ML could bridge that gap by making good predic-
tionsonfourtosixweektimescales[ 363].Thusfar,however,weathermodelershavehadhundreds
of times more test data than climate modelers, and began to adopt ML techniques earlier. Numer-
ousMLweathermodelsarealreadyrunninginproduction.Forexample,Gagneetal.recentlyused
an ensemble of random forests to improve hail predictions within a major weather model [262].
A full review of the applications of ML for extreme weather forecasting is beyond the scope of
this article. Fortunately, that review has already been written, see [529]. The authors describe ML

systems that correct bias, recognize patterns, and predict storms. Moving forward, they envision
human experts working alongside automated forecasts.
8.2.1 Storm Tracking. Climate models cannot predict the specific dates of future events, but
they can predict changes in long-term trends like drought frequency and storm intensity. Infor-
mation about these trends helps individuals, corporations, and towns make informed decisions
about infrastructure, asset valuation and disaster response plans (see also Section9.4). Identify-
ing extreme events in climate model output, however, is a classification problem with a twist: all
of the available datasets are strongly skewed because extreme events are, by definition, rare. ML
has been used successfully to classify some extreme weather events. Researchers have used deep
learningtoclassify[ 488],detect[ 652],andsegment[ 456]cyclonesandatmosphericrivers,aswell
as tornadoes [463], in historical climate datasets. Tools for more event types would be useful, as
wouldonlinetoolsthatworkwithinclimatemodels,labelleddatasetsforpredictingfutureevents,
and statistical tools that quantify the uncertainty in new extreme event forecasts.
8.2.2 Local Forecasts. High Leverage
Forecasts are most actionable if they are specific and local. ML is widely used to make local fore-
castsfromcoarse10–100kmclimateorweathermodelpredictions;variousauthorshaveattempted
this using support vector machines, autoencoders, Bayesian deep learning, and super-resolution
convolutional neural networks (e.g., [481]). Several groups are now working to translate high-
resolution climate forecasts into risk scenarios. For example, ML can predict localized flooding
patterns from past data [625], which could inform individuals buying insurance or homes. Since
MLmethodslikeneuralnetworksareeffectiveatpredictinglocalfloodingduringextremeweather
events [740], these could be used to update local flood risk estimates to benefit individuals. The
start-upJupiterIntelligenceisworkingtomakeclimatepredictionsmoreactionablebytranslating
climate forecasts into localised flood and temperature risk scores.
8.3 Discussion
ML may change the way that scientific modeling is done. The examples above have shown that
manycomponentsoflargeclimatemodelscanbereplacedwithMLmodelsatlowercomputational
costs. From an ML standpoint, learning from an existing model has many advantages: modelers
can generate new training and test data on-demand, and the new ML model inherits some com-
munitytrustfromtheoldone.ThisisanareaofactiveMLresearch.Severalpapershaveexplored
data-efficienttechniquesforlearningdynamicalsystems[ 658],includingphysics-informedneural
networks[659]andneuralordinarydifferentialequations[ 132];applicationsofphysics-informed
ML in climate science are now maturing rapidly [373, 412]. In the further future, researchers are
developing ML approaches for a wide range of scientific modeling challenges, including crash
prediction[497],adaptivenumericalmeshing[ 389],uncertaintyquantification[ 464,486],andper-
formance optimization [786]. If these strategies are effective, they may solve some of the largest
structural challenges facing current climate models.

9 SOCIETAL IMPACTS BY KRIS SANKARAN
Changes in the atmospherehave impacts on the ground. The expectedsocietalimpacts of climate
change include prolonged ecological and socioeconomic stresses as well as brief, but severe, so-
cietal disruptions. For example, impacts could include both gradual decreases in crop yield and
localized food shortages. If we can anticipate climate impacts well enough, then we can prepare
for them by asking:
•How do we reduce vulnerability to climate impacts?
•How do we support rapid recovery from climate-induced disruptions?
A wide variety of strategies have been put forward, from robust power grids to food shortage
prediction (Figure7), and while this is good news for society, it can be overwhelming for an ML
practitionerhopingtocontribute.Fortunately,afewcriticalneedstendtorecuracrossstrategies—
it is by meeting these needs that ML has the greatest potential to support societal adaptation
[251,296, 648]. From a high level, these involve

of remote sensing data [91, 92, 513, 637] (see also Section6.1). For example, tree cover can be

In sensor networks, individual nodes fail frequently, but are redundant by design—this is an op-
portunity for research into anomaly detection and missing data imputation [178, 345]. In marine

Monitoring biodiversity. High Leverage
Accurate estimates of species populations are the foundation on which conservation efforts are
built. Camera traps and aerial imagery have increased the richness and coverage of sampling
efforts. ML can help infer biodiversity counts from image-based sensors. For instance, camera
traps take photos automatically whenever a motion sensor is activated—computer vision can be
used to classify the species that pass by, supporting a real-time, less labor-intensive species count
[64, 585, 643]. It is also possible to use aerial imagery to estimate the size of large herds [805]o r
countbirds[ 282].Inunderwaterecosystems,MLhasbeenusedtoidentifyplanktonautomatically

Citizen science can also enable dataset collection at a scale impossible in individual studies
[93, 533, 634, 767]. For example, by leveraging public enthusiasm for birdwatching, eBird has
loggedmorethan140millionobservations[ 767],whichhavebeenusedforpopulationandmigra-
tion studies [424]. Computer vision algorithms that can classify species from photographs have

their influence [128].
Monitoring biodiversity may be paired with interventions to protect rare species or control
invasive pests. ML is providing new solutions to assess the impact of ecological interventions
[13,502,664] and prevent poaching [860].
9.2 Infrastructure
Physical infrastructure is so tightly woven into the fabric of everyday life—like the buildings we
inhabitandlights we switch on—thatit is easyto forget that it exists (seeSection4). Thefact that
somethingsobasicwillhavetoberethoughtinordertoadapttoclimatechangecanbeunsettling,
but viewed differently, the sheer necessity of radical redesign can inspire creative thinking.
We first consider the impacts of climate change on the built environment. Shifts in weather

A clear target is construction of physical defenses, for example, “climate proofing” cities with
new coastal embankments and increased storm drainage capacity. However, focusing solely on
defending existing structures can stifle proactive thinking about urban and social development—
forexample,floatingbuildingsarebeingtestedinRotterdam—andonemayalternativelyconsider
resilienceandrecoverymorebroadly[ 621,731].Fromthismoregeneralperspectiveofimproving
social processes, ML can support two types of activities: design and maintenance.
Designing infrastructure. Long-term
How can infrastructure be (re)designed to dampen climate impacts? In road networks, it is pos-
sible to incorporate flood hazard and traffic information in order to uncover vulnerable stretches
of road, especially those with few alternative routes [314]. If traffic data are not directly available,
it is possible to construct proxies from mobile phone usage and city-wide CCTV streams—these
are promising in rapidly developing urban centers [252, 381]. Overall flood hazard maps can be
improved using ML [455], and it is also possible to leverage data from real-world flooding events
[616], and to send localized predictions to those at risk [841]. For electrical, water, and waste col-
lectionnetworks,thesameprinciplecanguideinvestmentsinresilience—usingproxyorhistorical

Investments in water infrastructure can be optimized; for example, a larger dam might cost more
up front, but would have a larger storage capacity, giving a stronger buffer against drought. To
delay immediate decisions, infrastructure can be upgraded in phases—the technical challenge is
to discover policies that minimize a combination of long-term resource and societal costs under
plausible climate futures, with forecasts being updated as climates evolve [289,651, 727].

Maintaining infrastructure. High Leverage
What types of systems can keep infrastructure functioning well under increased stress? Two
strategiesforefficientlymanaginglimitedmaintenanceresourcesarepredictivemaintenanceand
anomaly detection; both can be applied to electrical, water, and transportation infrastructure (see
also Sections2.2 and 5.3). In predictive maintenance, operations are prioritized according to the
predicted probability of a near-term breakdown [201, 581, 702, 751]. For anomaly detection, fail-
ures are discovered as soon as they occur, without having to wait for inspectors to show up, or
complaints to stream in [51, 186].
Thesystemsreferencedherehaverequiredthemanualcurationofdatastreams,structuredand
unstructured. The data are plentiful, just difficult to glue together. Ideas from the missing data,
multimodal data, and AutoML communities have the potential to resolve some of these issues.
9.3 Social Systems
While less tangible, the social systems we construct are just as critical to the smooth functioning
of society as any physical infrastructure, and it is important that they adapt to changing climate
conditions. First, consider what changes these systems may encounter. Decreases in crop yield,
due to drought and other factors, will pose a threat to food security, as already evidenced by long
periods of drought in North America, West Africa, and East Asia [157, 636]. More generally, com-
munities dependent on ecosystem resources will find their livelihoods at risk, and this may result
in mass migrations, as people seek out more supportive environments.
At first, these problems may seem beyond the reach of algorithmic thinking, but investments
in social infrastructure can increase resilience. ML can amplify the reach and effectiveness of this
infrastructure.SeealsoSection 12forperspectiveonhowMLcansupportthefunctionandanalysis
of complex social environments.
Food security. High Leverage
Datacanbeusedtomonitortheriskoffoodinsecurityinrealtime,toforecastnear-termshortages,
and to identify areas at risk in the long-term, all of which can guide interventions. For real-time
and near-term systems, it is possible to distill relevant signals from mobile phones, credit card
transactions, and social media data [171, 434, 645]. These have emerged as low-cost, high-reach
alternativestomanualsurveying.Theideaistotrainmodelsthatlinktheselarge,butdecontextual-
ized,datawithgroundtruthconsumptionorsurveyinformation,collectedonsmallrepresentative

be viewed as a type of semi-supervised learning, and is fertile ground for research.
For longer-term warnings, spatially localized crop yield predictions are needed. These can be
generated by aerial imagery or meteorological data (see Section6.2), if they can be linked with
historical yield data [123,824]. Automatic crop type mapping can also be a valuable tool for yield
prediction[426,427].Ontheground,itispossibletoperformcrop-diseaseidentificationfromplant
photos—this can alert communities to disease outbreaks, and enhance the capacityof agricultural
inspectors. For even longer-run risk evaluation, it is possible to simulate crop yield via biological
and ecological models [446, 698, 783], presenting another opportunity for blending large scale
simulation with ML [605,835].
Beyond sounding alarms, ML can improve resilience of food supply chains. As detailed in Sec-
tion5, ML can reduce waste along these chains; we emphasize that for adaptation, it is important
that supply chains also be made robust to unexpected disruptions [203,568,639,665].
Resilient livelihoods.
Individuals whose livelihoods depend on one activity, and who have less access to community

r e s o u r c e s ,a r et h o s ew h oa r em o s ta tr i s k[7, 692]. Resilient livelihoods can be promoted through
increased diversification, cooperation, and exchange, all of which can be facilitated by ML sys-
tems. For example, they can guide equipment and information sharing in farming cooperatives,
via growers’ social networks [37]. Mobile money efforts can increase access to liquid purchasing
power; they can also be used to monitor economic health [253, 644]. Skill-matching programs
and online training are often driven by data, with some programs specifically aiming to benefit
refugees [54,516,646] (see also Section13).
Supporting displaced people. Long-term Uncertain Impact
Human populations move in response to threats and opportunities, and ML can be used to pre-
dict large-scale migration patterns. Work in this area has relied on accessible proxies, like social
media, where users’ often self-report location information, or aerial imagery, from which the ex-
tent of informal settlement can be gauged [82, 376, 650, 869]. More than quantifying migration
patterns, there have been efforts directly aimed at protecting refugees, either through improving
rescueoperations[ 492,628]ormonitoringnegativepublicsentiment[ 647].Itisworthcautioning
that immigrants and refugees are vulnerable groups, and systems that surveil them can easily be
exploited by bad actors. Designing methodology and governance mechanisms that allow vulner-
able populations to benefit from such data, without putting them at additional risk, should be a
research priority.
Assessing health risks.
Climate change will affect exposure to health hazards, and ML can play a role in measuring
and mitigating their impacts across subpopulations. Two of the most relevant expected shifts are
(1) heat waves will become more frequent and (2) outdoor and indoor air quality will deteriorate
[324,710].Theseexposureshaveeitherdirectorindirecteffectsonhealth.Forexample,prolonged

Thesedisciplinesareincreasinglyfocusedontherisksposedbyclimatechangespecifically.For
example, new sources of data have enabled detailed sensing of urban heat islands [137, 348, 815],
water quality [321, 440], and air pollution [130, 180]. Further, data on health indicators, which
are already collected, can quantitatively characterize observed impacts across regions as well as

Across social applications, there are worthwhile research challenges—guiding interventions

casting systems can be built from web data and specially-designed apps, in addition to traditional

search attempts to address these issues [472, 588]. Beyond surveillance, point-of-care diagnostics
have enjoyed a renaissance, thanks in part to ML [598, 648]. These are tools that allow health

In disaster preparation and response, two types of ML tasks have proven useful: creating maps
fromaerialimageryandperforminginformationretrievalonsocialmediadata.Accurateandwell-
annotated maps can inform evacuation planning, retrofitting campaigns, and delivery of relief
[59, 200]. Further, this imagery can assist damage assessment, by comparing scenes immediately

9.5 Discussion
Climate change will have profound effects on the planet, and the ML community can support
efforts to minimize the damage it does to ecosystems and the harm it inflicts on people. This
section has suggested areas of research that may help societies adapt more effectively to these
ever changing realities. We have identified a few recurring themes, but also emphasized the role
of understanding domain-specific needs. The use of ML to support societal resilience would be
a noble goal at any time, but the need for tangible progress towards it may never have been so
urgent as it is today, in the face of the wide-reaching consequences of climate change.
10 SOLAR GEOENGINEERING BY ANDREW S. ROSS
Airships floating through the sky, spraying aerosols; robotic boats crisscrossing the ocean,
firing vertical jets of spray; arrays of mirrors carefully positioned in space, micro-adjusted by
remote control; these images seem like science fiction, but they are actually real proposals for
solar radiation management, commonly called solar geoengineering [375, 418, 419, 728]. Solar
geoengineering, much like the GHGs causing climate change, shifts the balance between how
muchheattheEarthabsorbsandhowmuchitreleases.Thedifferenceisthatitisdonedeliberately,
and in the opposite direction. The most common umbrella strategy is to make the Earth more
reflective, keeping heat out, though there are also methods of helping heat escape (besides
CO2 removal, which we discuss in Sections6and 7).
Solargeoengineeringgenerallycomeswithahostofpotentialsideeffectsandgovernancechal-
lenges. Moreover, unlike CO2 removal, it cannot simply reverse the effects of climate change
(average temperatures may return to pre-industrial levels, but location-specific climates still
change),andalsocomeswiththeriskof terminationshock (fast,catastrophicwarmingifhumanity

undertakes solar geoengineering but stops suddenly) [615]. Because of these and other issues, it
is not within the scope of this article to evaluate or recommend any particular technique. How-
ever, the potential for solar geoengineering to moderate some of the most catastrophic hazards of
climatechangeiswell-established[ 374],andithasreceivedincreasingattentioninthewakeofso-
cietalinactiononmitigation.Although[ 418]arguethatthe“hardestandmostimportantproblems
raised by solar geoengineering are non-technical,” there are still a number of important technical
questions that ML may be able to help us study.
Overview.
The primary candidate methods for geoengineering are marine cloud brightening [396] (making
low-lyingcloudsmorereflective),cirrusthinning[ 759](makinghigh-flyingcloudstraplessheat),
and stratospheric aerosol injection [668] (which we discuss below). Other candidates (which are
eitherlesseffectiveorhardertoimplement)include“white-roof”methods[ 10]andevenlaunching
sunshades into space [29].
Injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere is considered a leading candidate for solar geo-
engineeringbothbecauseofitseconomicandtechnologicalfeasibility[ 527,743]andbecauseofa
reason that should resonate with the ML community: we have data. (These data are largely in the
form of temperature observations after volcanic eruptions, which release sulfates into the strato-
spherewhensufficientlylarge[ 691].)Onceinjected,sulfatescirculategloballyandremainaloftfor

come with a well-studied risk of ozone loss [210], and they make sunlight slightly more diffuse,
which can impact agriculture [642].
10.1 Understanding and Improving Aerosols
Design. Long-term
The effects and side-effects of aerosols in the stratosphere (or at slightly lower altitudes for cirrus
thinning [308]) vary significantly with their optical and chemical properties. Although sulfates
are the best understood due to volcanic eruption data, many others have been studied, including

Modeling.
One reason that sulfates have been the focus for aerosol research is that atmospheric aerosol
physics is not perfectly captured by current climate models, so having natural data is important
for validation. Furthermore, even if current aerosol models are correct, their best-fit parameters
muststillbedetermined(usinghistoricaldata),whichcomeswithuncertaintyandcomputational
difficulty. ML may offer tools here, both to help quantify and constrain uncertainty, and to man-
age computational load. As a recent example, [247] use Gaussian processes to emulate climate
modeloutputsbasedon ninepossibleaerosolparametersettings,allowingthemto establishplau-
sible parameter ranges (and thus much better calibrated error-bars) with only 350 climate model
runsinsteadof >100,000.Althoughthisisimportantprogress,ideallywewantuncertainty-aware
aerosol simulations with a fraction of the cost of one climate model run, rather than 350. ML may
be able to help here too (see Section8f o rm o r ed e t a i l s ) .

Efficient emulations and error-bars will be essential for what MacMartin and Kravitz [508]c a l l

to develop robust tools for estimating the extent and distribution of these potential harms. There
has been some recent work in applying ML to assess the impacts of geoengineering. For example,

use them to estimate the effects of solar geoengineering on agriculture. References [101, 187]u s e

data to estimate the past and future effects of temperature change on economic production. More
generally, the field ofIntegrated Assessment Modeling[422, 840] aims to map the outputs of a
climate model to societal impacts; for a general discussion of potential opportunities for applying
ML tointegrated assessment models (IAMs), see Section12.2.
10.4 Discussion
Any consideration of solar geoengineering raises many moral questions. It may help certain re-
gions at the expense of others, introduce risks like termination shock, and serve as a “moral haz-
ard”: widespread awareness of its very possibility may undermine mainstream efforts to cut emis-
sions[485].Becauseoftheseissues,therehasbeensignificantdebateaboutwhetheritisethically
responsibletoresearchthistopic[ 420,640].However,althoughitcreatesnewrisks,solargeoengi-
neering could actually be a moderating force against the terrifying uncertainties climate change
already introduces [374,509], and ultimately many environmental groups and governmental bod-
ies have come down on the side of supporting further research [145, 258, 592]. In this section, we
have attempted to outline some of the technical challenges in implementing and evaluating solar
geoengineering. We hope the ML community can help geoengineering researchers tackle these
challenges.

and provide constructive opportunities by modeling individual behavior.
11.1 Understanding Personal Carbon Footprint
Weasindividualsareconstantlyconfrontedwithdecisionsthataffectourcarbonfootprint,butwe
may lack the data and knowledge to know which decisions are most impactful. Fortunately, ML
canhelpdetermineanindividual’scarbonfootprintfromtheirpersonalandhouseholddata[ 790].
For example, natural language processing can be used to extract the flights a person takes from
their email, or determine specific grocery items purchased from a bill, making it possible to pre-
dict the associated emissions. Systems that combine this information with data obtained from the
user’s smartphone (e.g., from a ride-sharing app) can then help consumers who wish to identify
whichbehaviorsresultinthehighestemissions.GivensuchaMLmodel,counterfactualreasoning
canpotentiallybeusedtodemonstratetoconsumershowmuchtheiremissionswouldbereduced
for each behavior they changed. As a privacy-conscious alternative, emissions estimates could be
directly incorporated into grocery labels [562] or interfaces for purchasing flights. Such informa-
tion can empower people to understand how they can best help mitigate climate change through
behavior change.
Residences are responsible for a large share of GHG emissions [372] (see also Section4). A
large meta-analysis found that significant residential energy savings can be achieved [215], by
targetingtherightinterventionstotherighthouseholds[ 14,16,17].MLcanpredictahousehold’s
emissions in transportation, energy, water, waste, foods, goods, and services, as a function of its
characteristics [399]. These predictions can be used to tailor customized interventions for high-
emissions households [398]. Changing behavior both helps mitigate climate change and benefits
individuals; studies have shown that many carbon mitigation strategies also provide cost savings
to consumers [399].
Householdenergydisaggregationbreaksdownoverallelectricityconsumptionintoenergyuse

For example, it can be used to inform consumers of high-energy appliances of which they were
previously unaware. This alone could have a significant impact, since many devices consume a
largeamountofelectricityevenwhennotinuse;standbypowerconsumptionaccountsforroughly
8%ofresidentialelectricitydemand[ 507].AvarietyofMLtechniqueshavebeenusedtoeffectively
disaggregate household energy, such as spectral clustering, Hidden Markov Models, and neural
networks [33].
ML can also be used to predict the marginal emissions of energy consumption in real time, on
a scale of hours [832], potentially allowing consumers to effectively schedule activities such as
charging an EV when the emissions (and prices [439]) will be lowest [143]. Combining these pre-
dictions with disaggregated energy data allows for the efficient automation of household energy
consumption, ideally through products that present interpretable insights to the consumer
(e.g., [721, 760]). Methods like RL can be used to learn how to optimally schedule household ap-
pliances to consume energy more efficiently and sustainably [543, 679]. Multi-agent learning has
alsobeenappliedtothisproblem,toensurethatgroupsofhomescancoordinatetobalanceenergy
consumption to keep peak demand low [662,863].
11.2 Facilitating Behavior Change High Leverage
ML is highly effective at modeling human preferences, and this can be leveraged to help mitigate
climatechange.UsingML,wecanmodelandclusterindividualsbasedontheirclimateknowledge,
preferences,demographics,andconsumptioncharacteristics(e.g.,[ 66,116,166,261,861]),andthus

techniques have improved the enrollment rate of customers in an energy savings program by
2–3x [14]. Other works have used ML to predict how much consumers are willing to pay to avoid
potentialenvironmentalharmsofenergyconsumption[ 167],findingthatsomegroupsweretotally
insensitivetocostandwouldpaythemaximumamounttomitigateharm,whileothergroupswere
willing to pay nothing. Given such disparate types of consumers, targeting interventions toward
particular households may be especially worthwhile; all the more so because data show that the
sizeandcompositionofhouseholdcarbonfootprintsvariesdramaticallyacrossgeographicregions
and demographics [399].
Citizens who would like to engage with policy decisions, or explore different options to reduce
theirpersonalcarbonfootprint,canhavedifficultyunderstandingexistinglawsandpoliciesdueto

relevanttotheindividual(e.g.,basedonwheretheindividuallives).Thereisthepotentialfornatu-
rallanguageprocessingtoderiveunderstandableinsightsfrompolicytextsfortheseapplications,
similar to automated compliance checking [67,876].
Understanding individual behavior can help signal how it can be nudged. For example, path
analysis has shown that an individual’spsychological distanceto climate change (on geographic,
temporal, social, and uncertainty dimensions) fully mediates their level of climate change con-
cern [397]. This suggests that interventions minimizing psychological distance to the effects of
climate change may be most effective. Similarly, ML has revealed that cross-cultural support for
international climate programs is not reduced, even when individuals are exposed to information
about other countries’ climate behavior [65]. To make the effects of climate change more real for
consumers, and thus help motivate those who wish to act, image generation techniques such as
CycleGANshavebeenusedtovisualizethepotentialconsequencesofextremeweathereventson
houses and cities [716]. Gamification via deep learning has been proposed to further allow indi-
viduals to explore their personal energy usage [447]. All of these programs may be an incredibly
cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption; behavior change programs can cost as little as
3 cents to save a kilowatt hour of electricity, whereas generating one kWh would cost 5–6 cents
with a coal or wind power plant, and 10 cents with solar [207, 313].
11.3 Discussion
While individuals can sometimes feel that their contributions to climate change are dwarfed by
other factors, in reality individual actions can have a significant impact in mitigating climate
change. ML can aid this process by empowering consumers to understand which of their behav-
iors lead to the highest emissions, automatically scheduling energy consumption, and providing
insights into how to facilitate behavior change.
12 COLLECTIVE DECISIONS BY TEGAN MAHARAJ
& NIKOLA MILOJEVIC-DUPONT
Addressing climate change requires swift and effective decision-making by groups at multiple
levels—communities, unions, NGOs, businesses, governments, intergovernmental organizations,
andmanymore.Suchcollectivedecision-makingencompassesmanykindsofaction—forexample,
negotiating international treaties to reduce GHG emissions, designing carbon markets, building
resilient infrastructure, and establishing community-owned solar farms. These decisions often in-
volve multiple stakeholders with different goals and priorities, requiring difficult trade-offs. The
economic and societal systems involved are often extremely complex, and the impacts of climate-
related decisions can play out globally across long time horizons. To address some of these chal-
lenges,researchersareusingempiricalandmathematicalmethodsfromfieldssuchaspolicyanal-

ysis, operations research, economics, game theory, and computational social science; there are
many opportunities for ML to support and supplement these methods.
12.1 Modeling Social Interactions
When designing climate change strategies, it is critical to understand how organizations and in-
dividuals act and interact in response to different incentives and constraints.Agent-based mod-
els (ABMs)[168, 222] represent one approach used in simulating the actions and interactions
of agents (people, companies, etc.) in their environment. ABMs have been applied to a multitude
of problems relevant to climate change, in particular to study low-carbon technology adoption
[320, 584, 656, 878]. For example, when modeling solar PV adoption [875], agents may represent
individuals who act based on factors such as financial interest and the behavior of their peers
[88, 655]; the goal is then to study how these agents interact in response to different conditions,
such as electricity rates, subsidy programs, and geographical considerations. Here, ML can help
identify the roles of these conditions directly from data [58]. Other applications of ABMs include
modeling how behavior under social norms changes with external pressures [715], how the econ-
omy and climate may evolve given a diversity of political and economic beliefs [272], and how
individuals may migrate in response to environmental changes [787]. While agent and environ-
ment models in ABMs are often hand-designed by experts, ML can help integrate data-driven
insights into these models [874], for example, by learning rules or models for agents based on ob-
servational data [312, 875], or by using unsupervised methods such as variational autoencoders
orgenerativeadversarialnetworkstodiscoversalientfeaturesusefulinmodelingacomplexenvi-
ronment.Whilethehopeoflearningortuningbehaviorfromdataispromisingforgeneralization,
many data-driven approaches lose the interpretability for which ABMs are valued; work in inter-
pretable ML methods could potentially help with this.

12.2 Informing Policy
Theactionsrequiredtoaddressclimatechange,bothinmitigationandadaptation,requiremaking
policies31 at the local, national, and international levels [756]. Various institutions act as policy
makers: for instance, governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations,
standards committees, and professional institutions. Tools frompolicy analysis—the process of
evaluating the outcomes of past policies and assessing future policy alternatives32—can help in-
form the choices these institutions make. Policy analysis uses quantitative tools from statistics,
economics,andoperationsresearchsuchascost–benefitanalysis,uncertaintyanalysis,andmulti-
criteria decision-making to inform the policymaking process; see [555, 618] for an introduction.
ML can provide data for policy analysis, help improve existing tools for assessing policy options,
and provide new tools for evaluating the effects of policies.
30Mechanism design is often called “inverse game theory”—rather than determining optimal strategies for players, mech-
anism design seeks to design games such that certain strategies are incentivized.
31Policy can refer, for example, to laws, measures, standards, or best practices.
32The former is often referred to asex-post policy analysisand the latter asex-ante policy analysis.

Gathering data. High Leverage
When creating policies, decision-makers must often negotiate fundamental uncertainties in the
underlyingdata.MLcanhelpalleviatesomeofthisuncertaintybyprovidingdata.Forinstance,as
detailedelsewhereinthisarticle,MLcanhelppinpointsourcesofemissions(Sections 2.2and6.1),
approximate traffic patterns (Section3.1), identify infrastructure at risk (Section9.2), and mine
information from companies’ financial disclosures (Section14). Natural language processing, net-
work analysis, and clustering techniques can also be used to analyze social media data to under-
standpublicopinionsanddiscoursearoundclimatechange[ 436,812,844].Thesedatacanthenbe
used to identify areas of intervention, compute the benefits and costs of a project, or evaluate the
effectiveness of a policy after it has been implemented.
Assessing policy options.
Decision-makersoftenconstructmathematicalmodelstohelpthemassessortradeoffbetweendif-
ferentpolicyalternatives.MLisparticularlyrelevanttoapproachesthatmodellargeandcomplex
socio-economic systems to assess outcomes of particular strategies, as well as optimization-based
tools that help with navigating the decision.
Policy-makersoftenwishtoanalyzehowdifferentpolicyalternativesmaycontributetoachiev-
ing a particular objective. Computational approaches such as simulation and (partial) equilibrium
models can be used to compare different policy options, assess the effects of underlying assump-
tions, or propose strategies that are consistent with the objectives of decision-makers. Of particu-
larrelevancetoclimatechangemitigationareIAMs,whichincorporateeconomicmodels,climate

playaprominentroleintheIPCCassessments[ 561].Whilethesemodelscansimulateinteractions
between many variables in great detail, this comes at the cost of computational complexity and
presents opportunities for ML. Much as with Earth system models (Section8), ML can be applied

ing results at the appropriate spatial resolution, since different components of an IAM operate at

or surface temperature [481]. ML also has the potential to help with sensitivity and uncertainty
analysis[386],withfindingnumericalsolutionsforcomputationalexpensivesubmodels[ 206,714],
and assessing the validity of the models [556].
In addition to assessing the outcomes of various policies, policymakers may also employ
optimization-based tools to figure out what decisions to make. For example, combinatorial op-
timization is a powerful tool used widely for decision-making in operations research. See [70]f o r
a survey of how ML can be employed to help solve combinatorial optimization problems.
Tools from the field ofmulti-criteria decision-makingcan also help policymakers manage trade-
offs between different policies by reconciling competing objectives and minimizing negative side-
effects; in particular, in cases where policy objectives and constraints can be mathematically for-
malized,multi-objectiveoptimization canprovideapragmaticapproachtomakingdecisions.Here,
a decision-maker would formulate their decision-making process as an optimization problem by
combining multiple optimization objectives subject to physical or other types of constraints; the
goal is to then find a solution (or set of solutions) that isPareto-optimal with respect to all of the
objective functions. However, finding these solutions is often computationally expensive. Prac-
titioners have applied bio-inspired algorithms such as particle swarm, genetic, or evolutionary
algorithms to search for or compute Pareto-optimal solutions that satisfy the constraints. This

approach has been applied in a number of climate change-related fields, including energy and in-
frastructureplanning[ 38,325,525,635,732,856],industry[ 122,334],landuse[ 462,809],andmore
[127,317,539,761].Previousworkhasalsoemployedparallelsurrogatesearch,assistedbyML,to
efficiently solve multi-objective optimization problems [11]. Optimization algorithms which have
been successful in the context of hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Bayesian optimization [726, 745])
or guided search algorithms (e.g., tree search algorithms [738]) could also potentially be applied
to this problem.
Evaluating policy effects. High Leverage
Whencreatingnewpolicies,decision-makersmaywishtounderstandpreviouspolicies(e.g.,from
other jurisdictions) and how these policies performed. ML can help analyze previous policy ac-
tions automatically and at scale by improving computational text analysis. In particular, natural
language processing methods are already used in the field of political science to analyze political
texts and legislation [307]; these approaches could be promising for systematically studying cli-
mate change policies. Causal inference techniques can also help assess the effect of a particular
policy or climate-related event from observed outcomes. ML can play a role in causal inference
[41, 340, 619], including in the context of policy problems [40, 453] and in climate-relevant sce-
narios such as estimating the effects of temperature on human mortality [356] and the effects of
World Bank projects on vegetative cover [883].
12.3 Designing Markets
Ineconomics,GHGemissionscanbeseenasa negativeexternality:whileachangingclimateresults
in a cost for society, this cost is often not reflected in the market price of goods or services that
cause GHG emissions. This is problematic, since organizations and individuals making decisions
solely on the basis of market prices will tend to favor cheaper goods, even if those goods emit a
largeamountofGHGs.Market-basedtools 33 suchascap-and-tradeaimtoenforcepricesreflecting
the societal cost of GHGs and thus encourage socially beneficial behavior through market forces.
ML can help in understanding the impacts of market instruments; assessing their effectiveness at
reducing emissions; and supporting a swift, effective and fair implementation.34
Predicting carbon prices.
ThereareseveralapproachestopricingGHGemissions.Carbontaxesandquotasaimtoinfluence
the behavior of organizations by shaping supply and demand within an existing market. By con-
trast, cap-and-trade approaches such as those within the European Union involve a completely
new market, anEmissions Trading Scheme, within which companies can buy and sell a limited
number of GHG emissions permits. Prices within such cap-and-trade markets are highly sensi-
tive to control elements such as the number of permits released at a given time. ML can be used
to analyze prices within these markets, for example by predicting prices via supervised learning
[769,834, 890,892] or analyzing the main drivers of prices via hierarchical clustering [891].

a bandit problem [700], many works have applied bandit and other RL algorithms to determine

prices or other market values. For example, RL has been applied to predict bids [654] and market
power [572] in electricity markets, and to set dynamic prices in more general settings [510]. ML
can also help solve auctions in supply chains [708].
Assessing market effects.
When designing market-based strategies, it is necessary to understand how effectively each strat-
egy will reduce emissions, as well as how the underlying socio-technical system may be af-
fected.Studieshaveconsideredeffectsofcarbonpricingoneconomicgrowthandenergyintensity

populations, as fuel expenses are a bigger share of their total budget. Here, clustering can help
identify permit allocation schemes that maximize social welfare [855], and supervised learning
has been used to predict winners and losers from changing electricity tariff schemes [302]. He-
donic pricingcan also help identify how much different consumers may be willing to pay for a

can actually participate in a given market. For example, carbon markets can be more flexible if
viable offsets exist, including those offered by landowners who sequester carbon through forest

13 EDUCATION BY ALEXANDRA LUCCIONI
Access to quality education is a key part of sustainable development, with significant benefits for
climate and society at large. Education contributes to improving quality of life, helps individuals
make informed decisions, and trains the next generation of innovators. Education is also para-
mount in helping people across societies understand and address the causes and consequences
of climate change and provides the skills and tools necessary for adapting to its impacts. For in-
stance,educationcanbothimprovetheresilienceofcommunities,particularlyindevelopingcoun-
tries that will be disproportionately affected by climate change [801], and empower individuals,

itself may diminish educational outcomes for some populations, due to its negative effects on
agricultural productivity and household income [666, 667], this makes providing high-quality ed-
ucational interventions globally all the more important.
AI in Education. Long-term
ThereareanumberofwaysthatAIandMLcancontributetoeducationandteaching—forinstance,
by improving access to educational opportunities, helping personalize the teaching process, and
stepping in when teachers have limited time. The field ofArtificial Intelligence in EDucation
(AIED) has existed for over 30 years, and until recently relied on explicitly modeling content,
learners, and tutoring strategies based on psychological theories of learning. However, AIED is
increasingly incorporating data-driven insights derived from ML techniques.
One important area of AIED research has beenIntelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which
can adapt their behavior in real time according to the needs of individuals or to support collabo-
rative learning [124]. While ITSs have traditionally been defined and constructed by hand, recent
approacheshave applied ML techniquessuch as multi-armed bandit techniquesto adaptively per-
sonalize sequences of learning activities [135], LSTMs to generate questions to evaluate language
comprehension [205], and RL to improve the strategies used within the ITS [365, 441]. However,
there remains much work to be done to bridge the performance gap between digital and human
tutors, and ML-based approaches have an important role to play in this endeavor—for example,
via natural language processing techniques for creating conversational agents [295], learner ana-
lytics for classifying student profiles,[695], and adaptive learning approachesto proposerelevant
educational activities and exercises [774].35
While ITSs generally focus on individualized or small-group instruction, AIED can also help
providetoolsthatimproveeducationaloutcomesatscaleforlargergroupsoflearners.Forinstance,
scalable, adaptive online courses could give hundreds of thousands of learners access to learning
resourcesthattheywouldnotusuallyhaveintheirlocaleducationalfacilities[ 694].Furthermore,
givingteachersguidancederivedfromcomputationalteachingalgorithmsorheuristicscouldhelp
them design better educational curricula and improve student learning outcomes [172]. In this
context, AIED applications can be used either as a standalone tool for independent learners or as
an educational resource that frees up teachers to have more one-on-one time with students. Key
considerationsforcreatingAIEDtoolsthatcanbeappliedacrosstheglobeincludeadaptingtolocal
technologicalandculturalneeds,addressingbarrierssuchasaccesstoelectricityandinternet[ 430,
431], and taking into account students’ computing skills, language, and culture [106, 590].
Learning about climate.
Research has shown that educational activities centered on climate change and carbon footprints

suchasreducingenergyuse[ 142].Therehavealsobeenproposalsforinteractivewebsitesexplain-
ing climate science as well as educational interventions focusing on local and actionable aspects
of sustainable development [22]. In these contexts, ML can help create personalized educational
tools, for instance by generating images of potential future impacts of extreme weather events
based on a learner’s address [716] or by anchoring an individual’s learning experience in a digital
replica of their real-life location and allowing them to explore the way that climate change will
impact a specific location [28].

14 FINANCE BY ALEXANDRA LUCCIONI
The rise and fall of financial markets is linked to many events, both sporadic (e.g., the 2008 global
financial crisis) and cyclical (e.g., the price of gas over the years), with profits and losses that can
be measured in the billions of dollars and can have global consequences. Climate change poses a
substantial financial risks to global assets measured in the trillions of dollars [185], and it is hard

forecastingpotentialearnings,themajorityofthecurrentfinancialsystemisbasedonquarterlyor
yearly performance. This fails to incentivize the prediction of medium or long-term risks, which
include most climate change-related exposures such as physical impacts on assets or distribution
chains, legislative impacts on profit generation, and indirect market consequences such as supply
and demand.36
Climate investment.
Climate investment, the current dominant approach in climate finance, involves investing money
in low-carbon assets [229]. The dominant ways in which major financial institutions take this
approach are by creating “green” financial indexes that focus on low-carbon energy, clean tech-
nology,and/orenvironmentalservices[ 182]orbydesigningcarbon-neutralinvestmentportfolios
that remove or under-weight companies with relatively high carbon footprints [284]. This invest-
ment strategy is creating major shifts in certain sectors of the market (e.g., utilities and energy)
towards renewable energy alternatives, which are seen as having a greater growth potential than
traditional energy sources such as oil and gas [72]. While this approach currently does not utilize
ML directly, we see the potential in applying deep learning both for portfolio selection (based on
features of the stocks involved) and investment timing (using historical patterns to predict future
demand), to maximize both the impact and scope of climate investment strategies.
Climate analytics. High Leverage
The other main approach to climate finance isclimate analytics, which aims to predict the finan-
cial effects of climate change, and is still gaining momentum in the mainstream financial com-
munity [229]. Since this is a predictive approach to addressing climate change from a financial
perspective, it is one where ML can potentially have greater impact. Climate analytics involves
analyzinginvestmentportfolios,funds,andcompaniesinordertopinpointareaswithheightened
riskduetoclimatechange,suchastimbercompaniesthatcouldbebankruptedbywildfiresorwa-
ter extraction initiatives that could see their sources polluted by shifting landscapes. Approaches
used in this field include: natural language processing techniques for identifying climate risks
and investment opportunities in disclosures made by companies [254,442,498,752]a sw e l la sf o r
analyzing the evolution of climate coverage in the media to dynamically hedge climate change
risk [221]; econometric approaches for developing arbitrage strategies that take advantage of the
carbonriskfactorinfinancialmarkets[ 26];andMLapproachesforforecastingthepriceofcarbon
in emission exchanges37 [887,889].

to price future climate change impacts into their financial calculations. For an introduction to these topics, see [632]a n d

15 CONCLUSION
ML, like any technology, does not always make the world a better place—but it can. In the fight
against climate change, ML has significant contributions to offer across domain areas. ML can en-
able automatic monitoring through remote sensing (e.g., by pinpointing deforestation, gathering
data on buildings, and assessing damage after disasters). It can accelerate the process of scien-
tific discovery (e.g., by suggesting new materials for batteries, construction, and carbon capture).
ML can optimize systems to improve efficiency (e.g., by consolidating freight, designing carbon
markets,andreducingfoodwaste).Anditcanacceleratecomputationallyexpensivephysicalsim-
ulationsthroughhybridmodeling(e.g.,climatemodelsandenergyschedulingmodels).Theseand
other cross-cutting themes are shown in Table2. We emphasize that in each application, ML is
only one part of the solution; it is a tool that enables other tools across fields.
Applying ML to tackle climate change has the potential both to benefit society and to advance
the fieldof ML. Manyof the problems we have discussedhere highlight cutting-edge areasof ML,
such as interpretability, causality, and uncertainty quantification. Moreover, meaningful action
on climate problems requires dialogue with fields within and outside computer science and can
lead to interdisciplinary methodological innovations, such as improved physics-constrained ML
techniques.
