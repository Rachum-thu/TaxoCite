Abstract
Weather forecasting is essential but remains computationally in-
tensive and physically incomplete in traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods. Deep learning (DL) models offer effi-
ciency and accuracy but often ignore physical laws, limiting inter-
pretability and generalization. We propose PhyDL-NWP, a physics-
guided deep learning framework that integrates physical equations
with latent force parameterization into data-driven models. It pre-
dicts weather variables from arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates,
computes physical terms via automatic differentiation, and uses a
physics-informed loss to align predictions with governing dynam-
ics. PhyDL-NWP enables resolution-free downscaling by modeling
weather as a continuous function and fine-tunes pre-trained mod-
els with minimal overhead, achieving up to 170× faster inference
with only 55K parameters. Experiments show that PhyDL-NWP
improves both forecasting performance and physical consistency.

1 Introduction
Weather prediction remains one of modern science’s most complex
and vital challenges, with the nonlinear interactions between vari-
ous meteorological variables, the vast spatial and temporal scales
involved, and the chaotic nature of weather systems. The first-
principle approach to weather prediction, i.e., numerical weather
prediction (NWP), relies on mathematical models of atmospheric
and oceanic phenomena. NWP is often computationally intensive
at high resolution, and many unresolved physical processes such as
precipitation and radiation need to be represented by parameteriza-
tion. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in using machine
learning (ML) models for weather prediction. Deep learning models,
trained by nearly 40 years of European Center for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data [8], have
demonstrated remarkable ability to capture complex nonlinear rela-
tionships for tasks such as weather forecasting [28, 39] and down-
scaling [35]. However, despite the recent success of ML techniques,
the application of deep learning to weather prediction is not with-
out challenges. Existing ML models do not incorporate established
physical laws (e.g., fluid dynamics, thermodynamics) to ensure that
the derived variables are consistent with these laws.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) [ 30] have gained
prominence as alternatives to traditional numerical simulations,
offering innovative approaches to weather prediction. However,
weather prediction is inherently complex, involving numerous fac-
tors and processes that are influenced by local variations, boundary
condition changes, small-scale phenomena like microclimates, and
external forces. Many of these critical factors, which significantly
affect first-principle equations, are often missing from existing
datasets due to challenges in measurement and quantification. For
instance, the PDE governing temperature evolution (see Table 6) in-
cludes thermal diffusivity, which is not available in typical weather
datasets such as ERA5 and must instead be estimated through tur-
bulence parameterizations. Other unavailable terms include vertical
velocity, friction, etc. This poses a challenge to constructing com-
plete and accurate physical models, thereby limiting the fidelity of
physics-informed learning approaches in real-world settings.
In light of this challenge, we propose a novel framework,PhyDL-
NWP. This proposed paradigm first trains a neural network to
predict weather conditions based on spatio-temporal coordinates,

then leverages automatic differentiation for calculating partial dif-
ferential equation (PDE) terms. Based on this, we construct a library
of physics terms derived from first-principle equations that can
be represented using available dataset variables. To address unre-
solved processes and missing variables, we adopt a parametrization
strategy, introducing a latent force model as a parametrization term
to capture the effects of physical forces not explicitly represented
in the constructed PDEs.
This design enables PhyDL-NWP to generate super-resolution
weather data at arbitrary granularity, while simultaneously pro-
viding interpretable physical insights. Based on the constructed
governing equations that represent the physical principles, we
constrain and guide the optimization of deep learning models, en-
hancing model performance across datasets with varying climates
and sources. In extensive experiments across 17 baselines and four
datasets, we demonstrate that the learned parameterized PDEs align
closely with the desired physical equations. The physics-guided
models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts.
In short, our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose a novel physics-guided learning framework
PhyDL-NWP that completes weather equations using latent
force parameterization to inform deep learning models of
the underlying physical mechanism of meteorology.
• PhyDL-NWP directly provides a novel way to model weather
data in an online learning manner with unlimited granularity.
Weather downscaling can be done by simply feeding any
continuous coordinates to the model, without the need for
coarse-granular data as input during inference.
• PhyDL-NWP provides an effective paradigm for weather
forecasting by forcing the prediction to align with the pa-
rameterized weather equations via a physics-guided loss.
• PhyDL-NWP is extremely efficient and can be directly used
to fine-tune any pre-trained weather forecasting model. It
can be up to 170 times faster in inference than a standalone
model, with only up to 55 thousand parameters.
• The state-of-the-art performance of PhyDL-NWP is eval-
uated using both reanalysis and real-world observational
datasets, spanning global and local scales.PhyDL-NWP shows
consistency with the underlying physics in a variety of
weather variables.
2 Related Work
In the area of weather prediction, Numerical Weather Prediction
(NWP) [1, 21] is the current mainstream method. It uses mathemati-
cal models of the atmosphere and oceans, such as partial differential
equations (PDE), to predict future weather based on current weather
conditions. Some notable NWP models include European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)1, Global Forecast
System (GFS)2, etc. NWP can forecast weather in the medium range
but usually involves extensive computation. For example, ECMWF
operates one of the largest supercomputer complexes in Europe.
Recently, deep learning has emerged as another promising solu-
tion to weather forecasting [9, 29] and downscaling [26, 35] tasks.
1https://www.ecmwf.int/
2https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast
These deep learning models [7, 37] rely on different neural architec-
tures such as LSTM [15], CNN [38], GNN [19] and Transformer [39]
to capture the evolving dynamics and correlation across space and
time. Many large models have emerged in recent years. For example,
ClimaX [24], GraphCastNet [14], ClimateLearn [25], FengWu [3],
Pangu-Weather [2] all use backbones such as the Vision Trans-
former (ViT), UNet and autoencoders, for training a large model
for weather forecasting. WeatherBench [31] benchmarks the use
of pre-training techniques for weather forecasting. In addition,
FourcastNet [28] leverages the adaptive Fourier neural operator
(AFNO) [5, 16] to treat weather as a latent PDE system. In recent
years, a few studies such as NeuralGCM [13] and WeatherGFT [41]
have started to explore the integration of underlying physical mech-
anisms [36] in weather prediction. However, there are still no ex-
plicit efforts to use parameterization to ensure the completeness of
the primitive equations based on the data.
In addition, spatio-temporal modeling based on deep learning [18]
has thrived in recent years. Many previous works also approach the
weather prediction task from the perspective of spatio-temporal
modeling [6]. Dynamical systems modeling involves the formu-
lation of systems whose states evolve over time. Given the gov-
erning equations, physics-informed approaches [ 12, 30] use the
physics mechanism to enhance the dynamical systems. In the ab-
sence of governing equations, the identification of physical equa-
tions [4, 22, 23] is proposed to provide insights with respect to the
laws of physics.
3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Definition
We study a spatiotemporal weather dataset, denoted as
u = [𝑢1 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡), . . . , 𝑢ℎ (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡)] . (1)
Using the physics expression, this dataset comprises ℎ distinct
weather variable fields (such as temperature and pressure), each re-
lated to specific input coordinates (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡). Here, 𝑥 ∈ [ 1, . . . , 𝑛] and
𝑦 ∈ [ 1, . . . , 𝑚] represent spatial coordinates, while 𝑡 ∈ [ 1, . . . , 𝑇]
corresponds to the temporal dimension.
This dataset can be alternatively expressed as a sequence of
spatial “images”X = [𝑋1, . . . , 𝑋𝑇 ], with each “image”𝑋𝑖 being a
tensor in R𝑛×𝑚×ℎ, encapsulating the spatial and weather-factor
dimensions at each time point.
We focus on two primary tasks based on this dataset:
• Weather Downscaling: The goal is to generate super-resolution
weather “images”Y = [𝑌1, . . . , 𝑌𝑇 ] from X, where each 𝑌𝑖
is a tensor in R𝑛′ ×𝑚′ ×ℎ. The challenge is to derive this de-
tailed data from the original, coarser dataset X, with the
dimensions 𝑛′ > 𝑛 and 𝑚′ > 𝑚.
• Weather Forecasting: This task aims to find a model 𝑔 to
predict future weather conditions for a duration of 𝑟 hours,
represented as [X]𝑖+𝑟
𝑖+1 = [𝑋𝑖+1, . . . , 𝑋𝑖+𝑟 ]. These predictions
are based on observed data from the preceding 𝑠 + 1 hours,
[X]𝑖
𝑖 −𝑠 = [𝑋𝑖 −𝑠, . . . , 𝑋𝑖 ], for each time instance 𝑖. That is,
𝑔( [X]𝑖
𝑖 −𝑠 ) = [X]𝑖+𝑟
𝑖+1.

model 𝑓𝜃 approximates the weather data. Then, based on PyTorch’s auto-differentiation and the existing meteorology theory,
we calculate the derivatives for the construction of physical mechanisms driven by PDE. Last, based on linear regression, we
learn the PDE that fits the weather data well to provide physical guidance.
3.2 Meteorology Dynamics Representation
In this section, we aim to learn the physical mechanism represented
by PDE with parameterization to fit the weather data. A typical
partial differential equation (PDE) with parametrization terms has
the following form:

𝜕𝑥 2 , ..., u 𝜕u
𝜕𝑥 , ...] denotes a PDE term in the
equation (see examples in Sec. 4.3), with the set of 𝜉𝑖 as the coef-
ficients. 𝑄𝜋 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) denotes the latent force modeled by a neural
network that cannot be represented by Φ(u) explicitly, as a sup-
plement to missing variables unavailable in the weather dataset,
such as friction. Examples of Eq. 2 can be seen in Table 6, where
a physical equation is composed of both explicit PDE terms and
latent force parameterization.
3.3 Continuous Weather Downscaling
We develop a surrogate weather variable model ˆu = 𝑓𝜃 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡),
which takes the spatio-temporal coordinates as input and predicts
the ℎ weather variables. The schematic diagram of the proposed
surrogate model is shown in Fig. 1. Both 𝑓𝜃 and 𝑄𝜋 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) are de-
signed as feedforward neural networks that are commonly used
in the PINN literature [12, 30]. The joint optimization of 𝑓𝜃 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡),
𝜙 ( ˆu)𝑖, and 𝑄𝜋 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) allows the model to simultaneously learn to
predict weather variables and approximate the underlying physical
dynamics. Once 𝑓𝜃 achieves sufficient accuracy, its gradients via au-
tomatic differentiation enable the accurate calculation of PDE terms.
These inferred terms, together with 𝑄𝜋 , in turn guide the training
of 𝑓𝜃 , ensuring physical consistency in the learned mapping.
This framework supports continuous weather downscaling in
an online learning manner: once trained, 𝑓𝜃 can be queried with
any new coordinate (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) for real-time prediction. Unlike tra-
ditional downscaling methods that rely on discrete pairs of low-
and high-resolution training data, PhyDL-NWP treats weather data
as a continuous function over space-time. This enables arbitrary-
resolution inference without requiring coarse-resolution inputs or
pre-defined grid structures. Downscaling is performed simply by
evaluating 𝑌 = 𝑓𝜃 (𝑥 ′, 𝑦′, 𝑡) at any desired fine-grained coordinates
in real time, as described in Fig. 1, where 𝑥 ′ ∈ R𝑛′
, 𝑦′ ∈ R𝑚′
can
be any interpolation within the observed spatial domain, enabling
super-resolution modeling with minimal inference cost.
The overall loss function LD for weather downscaling is:
LD (𝜃, Ξ, 𝜋) = Ldata (𝜃 ) + 𝛼 Lphy (𝜃, Ξ, 𝜋), (3)

Here, data loss measures how well 𝑓𝜃 approximates 𝑢 well on the
weather data, and physical loss measures how well the learned
equation fits the weather data. The two regularization losses prevent
the overfitting of explicit PDE terms 𝑓𝜃 and the latent force 𝑄𝜋 .
3.4 Physics-Guided Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained
Weather Forecasting Models
In theory, 𝑓𝜃 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) can also take in future data coordinates and
produce the extrapolation directly. However, as 𝑓𝜃 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) is only
trained on historical weather data, while anywhere outside the
bounds of where the model was trained is completely unknown.
Empirically, we find that 𝑓𝜃 alone does not exhibit strong extrap-
olation or forecasting performance. To improve the extrapolation
ability, instead of using 𝑓𝜃 directly, we propose to take advantage
of the learned physical mechanism represented by Ξ and 𝑄𝜋 to
improve another forecasting model 𝑔𝜔, which takes historical spa-
tiotemporal data and predicts the future.
Moreover, once 𝑓𝜃 is trained, it can generate weather variables
at arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates (𝑥 ′, 𝑦′, 𝑡), enabling flexible
control over the resolution of historical data used to train or fine-
tune 𝑔𝜔. This allows seamless integration with any pre-trained
forecasting model by aligning spatiotemporal granularity as needed.
The overall framework of weather forecasting is depicted in
Fig. 2. To calculate differential terms efficiently, we propose to use
finite difference (FD) approximations on super-resolution data from
weather downscaling, which is extremely fast, instead of training a

are all hyperparameters to balance the different loss terms. As long
as the downscaling model 𝑓𝜃 is accurate, the recovered physics
offers a globally consistent constraint that enhances the generaliza-
tion of 𝑔𝜔 without adding substantial model complexity. The size
of the parameters as well as the inference speed of the different
models are summarized in Table 1. The number of parameters of
PhyDL-NWP is much smaller than other models, thus it is much
faster to perform forward/backward propagation on 𝑓𝜃 and 𝑔𝜔.
4 Experiments
We conduct both the forecasting and downscaling performance
comparisons. All experiments were carried out on four NVIDIA
A100 graphical cards. Only the performances on the test sets at
the optimal performance on the validation sets are reported. The
maximum training epochs are 50. Every result is the average of
three independent trainings under different random seeds. We se-
lect a few representative weather variables and the average of all
in the tables for visualization. The average of all variables reflects
the overall performance. We use two commonly used metrics [2]
for evaluation: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Anomaly Cor-
relation Coefficient (ACC). For both downscaling and forecasting,
we split by 8:1:1 for train/validation/test datasets in chronological
order. Code to implement PhyDL-NWP is available in GitHub3.

4.1 Downscaling Performance Comparison
We evaluate the effectiveness of PhyDL-NWP and other baseline
models for weather downscaling on a real-world dataset Huadong,
which is derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational forecast (HRES) and re-
analysis (ERA5) archive. It comprises a grid of 64 × 44 cells, with
each cell having a grid size of 0.25 degrees in both latitude and
longitude. More data details can be found in Appendix A.1. Since
most previous studies on weather downscaling can only handle the
downscaling of the two spatial dimensions, for the sake of compari-
son, we also only report the performance ofPhyDL-NWP on spatial
downscaling in Table 2. We perform 2x and 4x downscaling tasks
with 0.5 and 1 degrees resolutions, respectively. To facilitate this,
the 0.25-degree HRES data undergoes linear interpolation to gener-
ate the requisite 0.5-degree and 1-degree input data. We compare
our model against the Bicubic interpolation, FSRCNN [ 27], Res-
DeepD [32], EDSR [10], RCAN [43], YNet [20], DeepSD [35], and
GINE [26]. For the deep learning baselines, channel-wise normal-
ization is performed for efficiency. Unlike prior methods that rely
on fine-granular labels for supervision, PhyDL-NWP learns from
coarse-granular inputs alone by aligning with physical principles,
enabling it to perform super-resolution without labeled training
outputs. Details about baselines can be found in Appendix A.2.4.
From Table 2, we can conclude that PhyDL-NWP provides a
significant improvement up to 20.1% to 24.6% on average over RMSE
against the baseline models. Well-recognized deep learning models
like FSRCNN and YNet achieve much worse results, which could
be because most models only consider the downscaling of spatial
dimensions, neglecting the patterns in the temporal dimension.
Moreover, weather data is multivariable, and the spatio-temporal
dependencies are complex, making it difficult to recover the ground-
truth information without global modeling. Furthermore, we find
that the RMSE for 2x and 4x resolutions is close. SincePhyDL-NWP
can provide infinite resolution results given continuous coordinates,
we believe that it will be accurate for higher resolution downscaling,
based on this evidence. Moreover, PhyDL-NWP can easily perform
downscaling in the temporal dimension. We only experiment on
spatial dimension to align with existing models.

from the Ningbo Meteorological Bureau6. Ningbo and Ningxia cover
two different terrains and climate types in 0.25 degrees resolution,
while WeatherBench covers the global weather in 5.625 degrees

average of all weather variables.
resolution. On each grid in both datasets, we select the most impor-
tant observational weather information for evaluation. See more
details in Appendix A.1. We perform multiple experiments based
on the length of future prediction, ranging from one hour to seven
days. Due to the GPU memory limitation, we use the eight weather
variables of only ten hours in the past to predict all eight weather
variables in the future.
There are five kinds of baseline models in comparison, including:
(1) Physics-based models: NWP, PINN [30], PINO [17]; (2) Meteoro-
logical models: Bi-LSTM-T [42], Hybrid-CBA [7]; (3) Vision models:
ConvLSTM [33], FourcastNet [28] based on AFNO [5], ClimaX [24];
(4) Spatio-temporal graph models: MTGNN [40], MegaCRN [11],
GraphCast [14]. Some baseline models are slightly modified to
adapt to the multi-step prediction setting and/or specific modeling
resolution, with details described in the Appendix A.2.4. Besides
deep learning models, we also compare these models with the Nu-
merical Weather Prediction (NWP) results provided by ECMWF
IFS and the Physical-Informed Neural Network (PINN) [30] based
on the PDEs learned by PhyDL-NWP. We denote the baseline mod-
els as BaseModels and incorporate them with PhyDL-NWP as
BaseModels+.
4.2.1 Regional Weather Forecasting. In particular, the result of re-
gional forecasting details with seven days are reported in Table 3
in the main manuscript and Table 5 in the appendix, as it repre-
sents the model’s capability of long-term medium-range regional
weather prediction. The vanilla PINN does not seem to be effective,
while the improvement provided by PhyDL-NWP is consistently
significant. For Ningbo dataset, the overall improvement on the av-
erage of all weather variables is up to 7.18% over RMSE and 14.0%
over ACC; for Ningxia dataset, the overall improvement on that is
up to 5.48% over RMSE and 18.8% over ACC. All the results are
statistically significant. Furthermore, we find that NWP is good
in ACC, while being the worst in RMSE. Deep learning models, on
the other hand, greatly outperform NWP in RMSE, showing great
advantage in modeling capacity.
To understand the holistic properties of PhyDL-NWP, we con-
duct detailed analyses on the Ningxia dataset. First, the comparison
of different models for different forecasting ranges is visualized in
Fig. 3. BaseModels+ excels BaseModels and NWP at all time steps.
As the forecasting range increases, the deep learning performance
decreases quickly. The improvement provided byPhyDL-NWP, how-
ever, is increasing in the forecasting range, which highlights its
unique advantages of guiding models for long-term forecasting.
In addition, based on AFNO from FourcastNet, we visualize its
forecasting comparison at the 10-th time frame in Fig. 4. PhyDL-
NWP clearly improves the performance of the existing deep model,
making the forecasting results closer to the ground truth. Specifi-
cally, “Total precipitation” is not a typical physical quantity and is
hard to predict due to lack of effective physical equation. While the
vanilla AFNO is a total disaster, AFNO+ provides information about
which local areas receive concentrated rainfall. This effectively
demonstrated the success of our implemented parameterization
strategy with the latent force model.
4.2.2 Global Weather Forecasting. Besides regional weather fore-
casting, we also test PhyDL-NWP on the global weather forecasting
task, which is the benchmark for a lot of recent works. The results
with WeatherBench dataset for global weather forecasting are re-
ported in Table 4. In comparison, PhyDL-NWP shows a lot more
improvements over baseline models in the coarser-granular Weath-
erBench dataset, with statistically significant improvement
over RMSE. It is also worth noting that, even for the state-of-the-
art GraphCast model, there is still an improvement. Moreover, as re-
ported in Table 1, PhyDL-NWP module is extremely light-weighted
and efficient, with a time cost that is 55∼170 times faster than
the base forecasting models. The integration of physics and deep
learning is clearly demonstrated in this study.
4.3 Meteorology Dynamics Interpretation
To understand how PhyDL-NWP is grounded on laws of physics,
we compare the learned dynamics by PhyDL-NWP from Huadong
dataset with the basic equations of NWP [34]. These equations orig-
inate from conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. PhyDL-
NWP will explicitly use the terms that appear in the first-principle
equations and can be represented based on the dataset, while model-
ing the rest of the dynamics using latent force parameterization. As
shown in Table 6, our latent parameterization strategy is proposed
considering that many terms cannot be modeled explicitly, due to
missing records in the data or difficulty to measure.

For the modeling of temperature, the basic equation originates
from the 3D convection-diffusion equation for heat transfer. Tem-
perature 𝑇 is influenced by advection (movement of heat due to
fluid flow, represented by the velocity components𝑈 , 𝑉 and a ver-
tical component 𝑊 along height 𝑧), diffusion (spread of heat due to
thermal diffusivity 𝑘), and a heat source 𝐻. In addition, 𝑡 denotes
time, 𝑥 and 𝑦 denote space, 𝑈10 represents the wind components at
the heights of 10m. An example of meteorology dynamics of tem-
perature (t) of WeatherBench dataset in the year of 2018 is shown
in Fig. 5. We found that 𝑄 and ΦΞ substitute each other well and
the combination generally matches 𝜕𝑇

For wind velocity, the compared basic equation originates from
the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The velocity is influenced by con-
vective acceleration, the gradient of pressure 𝑝 with fluid density
𝜌, the diffusion of momentum due to viscosity 𝜈 for velocity of
all directions u, and external force 𝐹𝑓𝑥 along the 𝑥 direction (such
as friction). It is obvious that the WeatherBench dataset does not
provide all the necessary variables to complete the equation. Our
latent force model will address this problem well. Similarly, for
surface pressure, the learned equation aligns with the 3D wave
equation while the missing vertical component is for the latent
force 𝑄 to capture. For humidity, the equation originates from the
conservation of mass, and combines the advection, diffusion and
source terms, where 𝑞 is the humidity, and 𝑆𝑞 is the source term
for humidity (e.g., evaporation, condensation). We approximate
precipitation using a parameterized PDE for humidity as a tractable
surrogate that captures its dominant drivers.

5 Conclusion
We introduce PhyDL-NWP, a light-weighted physics-guided deep
learning framework for weather downscaling and forecasting. By in-
corporating parameterized physical dynamics through latent force
modeling, PhyDL-NWP enables continuous, resolution-free pre-
dictions while ensuring consistency with governing equations. It
can augment and fine-tune existing forecasting models with mini-
mal overhead, significantly improving both accuracy and physical
plausibility. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demon-
strate its effectiveness, scalability, and interpretability, positioning
PhyDL-NWP as a practical and generalizable module for modern
meteorological modeling.

For weather downscaling, the Huadong dataset consists of HRES
and ERAs datasets. HRES represents a 10-day atmospheric model
forecast, while ERA5 serves as a global atmospheric reanalysis, in-
corporating climate and weather observations. For regional down-
scaling, we construct a real-world dataset called "Huadong", cover-
ing the east China land and sea areas. In this dataset, HRES data is
employed as the predictive data, while ERA5 reanalysis data serves
as the ground truth.
Huadong dataset: The Huadong dataset encompasses a latitude
range from 26.8◦ 𝑁 to 42.9◦ 𝑁 and a longitude range from112.6◦ 𝐸 to
123.7◦ 𝐸. It comprises a grid of 64 × 44 cells, with each cell having a
grid size of 0.25 degrees in both latitude and longitude. Notably, the
Huadong dataset also incorporates Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
data to represent terrain information. Since the terrain information
usually refers to the boundary layers in the meteorology model
instead of an individual weather factor in the PDE, for simplicity,
we do not use this information in the paper. The HRES and ERA5
data cover the period from January 3, 2020, to April 1, 2022. The
scores of the average of variables reported in Table 2 are computed
based on all eight factors. Due to space limits, we only report the
specific scores for four factors.
For weather forecasting, both Ningbo and Ningxia datasets con-
sist of two main components: geographic data and meteorological
data. The geographic data includes latitude, longitude, and DEM
(Digital Elevation Model) information. The DEM information is
commonly used in geographic information systems to represent
the terrain of the area. On the other hand, the meteorological data
in these datasets consist of various weather factors. These factors
typically include wind speed, temperature, and pressure. These
data provide information about the atmospheric conditions at dif-
ferent locations within the study area. To organize and represent
the data, a grid format is used. In this format, the study area is
divided into grids, and each grid cell represents a specific location.
Within each grid cell, both the geographic and meteorological data
for that location are stored.
Ningbo dataset: The Ningbo dataset represents a coastal area
spanning from latitude 28.85◦N to 30.56◦N and longitude 120.91◦E
to 122.29◦E. It is divided into a grid system comprising 58 grids
in the latitude direction and 47 in the longitude direction. Each
grid has a size of 0.03 degrees in both latitude and longitude. The
DEM data are collected from ETOPO17. The meteorological data
are collected from Ningbo Meteorological Bureau 8, including 10
weather factors from 1/Jan/2021 to 1/Apr/2021 with 1-hour sample
rate. Therefore, this dataset is real measurement data, rather than a
typical reanalysis dataset.
Ningxia dataset: The Ningxia dataset represents a mountainous
area spanning from latitude 34.5◦N to 42◦N and longitude 106◦E
to 116◦E. There are 30 ×40 grids with a grid size of 0.25 degrees
in both latitude and longitude. The DEM data are collected from
ETOPO1. The meteorological data are collected from ECMWF’s
ERA59, including 8 weather factors from 1/Jan/2021 to 1/Dec/2021
with 1-hour sample rate. For variable temperature, the atmosphere
level is 500.
WeatherBench dataset: The WeatherBench dataset10 repre-
sents a global weather dataset. We select the version with 5.625
degrees resolution, sampling rate of 6 hours, from 2008 to 2018,
with five weather factors. This dataset originates from ECMWF’s
ERA5 as well. For variable 𝑧 (geopotential), the atmosphere level is
500. For variable 𝑡 (temperature), the atmosphere level is 850.
In the forecasting experiments, we divide each dataset into train,
validation, and test sets using an 8:1:1 ratio in chronological order.
The scores of the average of variables reported in Table 5 are com-
puted based on all eight factors. Due to space limits, we only report
the specific scores for four factors.
A.2 Experimental details
We choose the learning rate at 1e-4, batch size of PhyDL-NWP at
10000, and hidden dimension at 100. We perform grid search in
[1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 0.1, 1, 10] for the following hyperparameters
and select them as: 𝛼 at 10, 𝛽 at 1e-2.
The neural network used for 𝑓𝜃 and 𝑄𝜋 both consists of 8 hidden
layers, where each layer has 100 neurons. MLP is the most com-
monly used model architecture in the literature of PINN, which
leverages the universal function approximation capabilities to model
complex mappings from inputs like (x, y, t) to outputs such as
weather variables. This allows inference at any arbitrary resolution
because the model outputs values at any real-valued coordinate,
not restricted to the training grid.
We employ both automatic differentiation and finite difference
(FD) methods in this paper. Specifically, once the neural network𝑓𝜃
accurately approximates the weather data, we leverage PyTorch’s

automatic differentiation to compute derivatives. PyTorch con-
structs a dynamic computational graph during forward operations,
where each tensor records its computation history. When comput-
ing the output 𝑦 = 𝑓𝜃 (𝑡), invoking y.backward() enables access to
the derivative with respect to 𝑡 via t.grad.
The finite difference (FD) method, on the other hand, is much
simpler, but also much quicker. It approximates derivatives using
discrete points. For the first derivative of a function 𝑢 (𝑡), there are:
A.2.1 Forward Difference.
𝑑𝑢
𝑑𝑡 ≈ 𝑢 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) − 𝑢 (𝑡)
Δ𝑡 + O (Δ𝑡)
A.2.2 Backward Difference.
𝑑𝑢
𝑑𝑡 ≈ 𝑢 (𝑡) − 𝑢 (𝑡 − Δ𝑡)
Δ𝑡 + O (Δ𝑡)
A.2.3 Central Difference.
𝑑𝑢
𝑑𝑡 ≈ 𝑢 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) − 𝑢 (𝑡 − Δ𝑡)
2Δ𝑡 + O (Δ𝑡 2)
We adopt the finite difference (FD) method to compute deriva-
tives in the weather forecasting model 𝑔𝜔 (Eq. 8), as automatic
differentiation is not applicable— 𝑔𝜔 does not explicitly take time 𝑡
as an input, unlike 𝑓𝜃 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡). Another advantage is that first-order
finite difference (FD) is much faster than automatic differentiation
(auto-diff) because FD only requires basic arithmetic on neighbor-
ing grid points. Auto-diff has to traverse the computation graph
and involves memory-heavy backward passes, especially for deep
networks or large spatiotemporal inputs.
A.2.4 Forecasting baselines.
• PINN [30]: a physics-informed feedforward neural network
that incorporates known physical laws (e.g., PDEs) as soft
constraints during training to improve generalization and
physical consistency.
• Bi-LSTM-T [42]: a deep learning (DL) model that uses Bi-
LSTM for weather prediction.
• Hybrid-CBA [7]: a hybrid DL model that combines CNN,
LSTM, and attention models for weather forecasting and
correction.
• ConvLSTM [33]: a hybrid DL model that extends LSTM with
convolutional gates.
• PINO [17]: a physics-informed neural operator that learns
solution operators for PDEs directly, enabling efficient infer-
ence and better scalability than traditional PINNs.
• AFNO [5, 28]: a DL model that adapts Fourier neural operator

model for weather forecasting.
• FourcastNet [28]: a foundation model for global weather
forecasting based on Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators.
• GraphCast [14]: a foundation model for global weather pre-
diction based on encoder-decoder with message passing.
Since most forecasting baselines are designed for single-step fu-
ture prediction by default, we modify their neural architecture by
multiplying the output dimension of the second-last layer (usually
at the end of an LSTM or Conv block, before passing through the
feed-forward network at the end) by the number of prediction steps.
Since different baselines may operate on different resolutions of
data, we will use interpolation to map to the desired resolution.

nique that uses the values and gradients of the function at
surrounding grid points to obtain a smooth and continuous
interpolated result.

vision, leveraged for both downscaling and single-image
super-resolution, which conducts feature mapping using
multi-layer CNNs and executes upsampling via deconvolu-
tion layers.
• ResDeepD [32]: a deep model that begins with an upsampling
of the input to increase dimensions before proceeding to
feature mapping via ResNet.
• EDSR [10]: a deep model that first conducts feature mapping
using ResNet and then performs upsampling.
• RCAN [43]: a deep model based on ResNet that incorporates
a global pooling layer for channel attention.
