  content: This paper introduces a new p-regions model called the Network-Max-P-Regions (NMPR) model. The NMPR is a regionalization
    model that aims to aggregate n areas into the maximum number of regions (max-p) that satisfy a threshold constraint and
    to minimize the heterogeneity while taking into account the influence of a street network. The exact formulation of the
    NMPR is presented, and a heuristic solution is proposed to effectively compute the near-optimized partitions in several
    simulation datasets and a case study in Wuhan, China.

  content: 'With the introduction of the p-regions problem (Duque et al . 2011b), the use of mixed integer programming (MIP)
    for regionalization has increased in the max-p-regions model (Duque et al. 2012), the p-functional regions model (Kim
    et al. 2013), and the p-compact regions model (Li et al . 2014b). However, most models ignore transportation networks
    (Borgatti et al . 2009). In addition, streets constrain human activities (Wheeler 1973, Whitehand and Larkham 1992, Jiang
    and Claramunt 2004).


    This paper extends the max-p-regions model (Duque et al. 2012) to the Network-Max-P-Regions (NMPR) model. This is a regionalization
    model that aims to aggregate n areas into a maximum number of regions (max-p) such that (1) the resulting regions minimize
    a measure of intraregional heterogeneity, in terms of a set of areal attributes (e.g., slope, types of soil, types of
    land use, price); (2) the areas along streets can be grouped into ‘corridor regions,’ and other areas are grouped into
    ‘max-p regions;’ and (3) each region must satisfy the condition that the value of a spatially extensive areal attribute
    (e.g., population, households, size) exceeds a predefined threshold value.


    Physical constraints imposed by transportation networks shape the way in which human dynamics evolve (Jiang and Jia 2011).
    Therefore, the presence of a road might modify the attributes of the areas along it (e.g., percentage of vegetation cover,
    income, population density, commercial activity, land prices, percentage of impervious surfaces). This influence can be
    asymmetrical or symmetrical. The asymmetrical influence leads to the different attributes of the areas on either side
    of the road. For example, ring roads usually create a clear division between rural and urban areas (e.g., the northern
    edge of the A10 in Amsterdam, Netherlands), and streets separate neighborhoods with different socioeconomic characteristics
    (e.g., the 8 Mile Road in Detroit, USA). In those cases, the road acts as a regional border. The symmetrical influence
    might generate areas with similar attributes along both sides of the road (e.g., shopping strips, edge cities, or fishbone
    deforestation along roads). In this case, the regionalization process tends to generate corridor regions along the roads.


    However, due to the nature of the phenomenon (e.g., wildlife trails), or because of its short time period (e.g., recently
    constructed roads), the presence of the road may not have modified the attributes of the areas along it. In these cases,
    if the road is not explicitly included in the regionalization model, the infrastructure will be ‘invisible’ to the model.
    The NMPR is useful in such cases in which the influence of the roads cannot be captured through the area attributes, but
    the practitioner wants the resulting regions to be affected by those roads. To the best of our knowledge, the NMPR is
    the first regionalization model that allows for two types of regions: corridor regions (elongated regions along roads)
    and max-p-regions (shape-free regions located either close to or far from roads).


    Well-defined corridor regions are important in spatial planning. With proper land use planning along the roads connecting
    cities, the benefits of a road can spread to the intermediate areas that it crosses. Habitat attributes and information
    about migratory pathways can be integrated within the NMPR to delineate wildlife corridors used to protect species. In
    intra-urban applications, the NMPR can use a street network and block-wise commercial activity to design a zoning plan
    that includes both elongated shopping strips and compact business districts.


    The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review. The problem formation is established in Section
    3. Section 4 explains the heuristic framework used to solve the problem. Section 5 illustrates the proposed approach using
    several simulated datasets and a case study in Wuhan City, China. The last section discusses the strengths and limitations
    of the proposed method and suggests future work.'

  content: 'Regionalization addresses the aggregation of spatial units (hereafter areas) into contiguous regions. It has been
    widely studied since the early 1960s, when electoral districting became a matter of quantitative modeling (Vickrey 1961,
    Nagel 1965, Bunge 1966, Aboolian et al . 2009). A few years later, the concept of spatial contiguity was applied to school
    districting (Clarke and Surkis 1968), sales territory alignment (Hess and Samuels 1971), health care districting (Thomas
    1979), zone design (Openshaw 1977), and police patrol areas (Curtin et al . 2010), among others (see Duque et al . 2007
    for a literature review of regionalization). Since the appearance of the p-regions problem as an MIP formulation of the
    regionalization problem (Duque et al. 2011b), research in this area has focused on proposing new exact formulations (Duque
    et al . 2012, Kim et al . 2013, Li et al . 2014b) and exploring new possibilities for solving large instances of this
    NP-hard problem using parallel computing (Laura et al . 2015). These regionalization algorithms are implemented in spatial
    analytical libraries, such as PySAL (https://pysal.readthedocs.io), and are integrated into GIS platforms (such as ArcGIS
    and QGIS) to assist researchers and practitioners in solving real-world spatial problems.


    The max-p-regions model (Duque et al. 2012) is the first MIP model to endogenize the number of regions. This is achieved
    by maximizing the number of homogeneous regions such that the value of a spatially extensive regional attribute (e.g.,
    area, population, presence of a given type of facility) is above a predefined threshold value. Because intraregional homogeneity
    is an important characteristic in regionalization, maximizing the number of regions is a good condition to keep heterogeneity
    low (minimum aggregation bias).


    The use of road networks in regionalization serves two purposes: first, it defines neighboring relationships between areas
    (Zoltners and Sinha 1983). In this case, two areas are neighbors if there is a road that connects them. This representation
    allows the inclusion of natural obstacles, such as mountains, lakes, and rivers. Second, it quantifies the attractiveness
    between areas by measuring flows of people, vehicles or products. This method is useful in designing functional or compact
    regions (Kim et al . 2013).


    Our NMPR model proposes a novel way to incorporate road networks into regionalization problems. In our model, the road
    network exerts an influence on the shape of the regions by considering the position of the areas relative to the road
    network. Thus, areas closer to roads tend to group along the roads, forming what we call ‘corridor regions.’ A challenging
    condition in the design of this model is that corridor regions are a possibility rather than a requirement. Corridor regions
    occur when they do not degrade the intra-regional homogeneity. This implies that corridor regions will not appear everywhere
    along the road network but only where they are needed.


    The NMPR is an NP-hard problem, implying that the computational complexity increases rapidly with the number of areas.
    This characteristic precludes the use of exact optimization techniques in large instances of the problem and requires
    the use of heuristic methods. Because of its capacity to escape from local optimal solutions, the Tabu search algorithm
    (Bozkaya et al . 2003) has proved to be the best option when addressing regionalization problems. It has been applied
    in political districting by Bozkaya et al . (2003) and Ricca and Simeone (2008), in zone design by Openshaw and Rao (1995),
    in home care districting by Blais et al . (2003), and more recently for the max-p-regions problem (Duque et al . 2012)
    and the p-compact-regions (Li et al . 2014a).'

    Objective function has three terms combined in such a way that term I dominates terms II and III. This is achieved by
    multiplying term I by a scaling factor 10^h, with h = 1 + log P_i P_j|j≠i dij. When terms I, II, and III are added as
    a single value (-I + II - III), this scaling factor moves the term I to the left so that it is not combined with terms
    II and III. This strategy was first applied by Duque et al . (2012) in the max-p-regions model.


    Term I represents the number of regions calculated as the sum of root areas (i.e., the area assigned at order equal to
    zero, xk0_i). To maximize the number of regions, term I is multiplied by −1 so that the greater the number of regions,
    the lower the objective function. Term II adds dissimilarity between areas assigned to the same region (i.e., tij = 1).
    For this, practitioners can use either distance or dissimilarity functions in a univariate or multivariate context. Finally,
    term III represents an incentive to create corridor regions by subtracting a portion of the intraregional heterogeneity
    of the corridor region from term II. The portion to be subtracted is determined by a factor f with the following structure:


    f(si,Oi, sj,Oj) = MaxDisc - MaxDisc/MaxDist * (si,Oi + sj,Oj)


    where MaxDisc is the maximum discount to be applied to dij. The maximum discount occurs when both areas i and j are very
    close to a road (i.e., si,Oi + sj,Oj → 0). This MaxDisc decreases as the distance between i or j and the road increases
    (i.e., si,Oi + sj,Oj → ∞). MaxDist indicates the threshold distance beyond which the discount becomes negative, which
    discourages the appearance of corridor regions far from roads.


    Note that areas closer to the roads have a greater incentive to become corridor areas because the discount is higher.
    The discount function can have other functional forms depending on the research question.


    Solutions with a higher number of regions are always preferred, and for a given number of regions, solutions with lower
    intraregional heterogeneity (calculated with terms II and III) are preferred over solutions with higher intraregional
    heterogeneity. Constraints (2)–(8) correspond to the max-p-regions. Constraints (2)–(4) guarantee the spatial contiguity
    of the regions by using an extension of the ordered-area assignment conditions proposed by Cova and Church (2000). Constraint
    (2) guarantees that each region k has no more than one root area. Constraint (3) requires that each area i is assigned
    to only one region k and only one order c. Constraint (4) ensures spatial contiguity by allowing an area i to be assigned
    to a given region k in order c if and only if there exists an area j in the neighborhood of i that is assigned to the
    same region k in the order c-1. Constraint (5) ensures that each region satisfies the minimum threshold value imposed
    over a spatially extensive attribute. Constraint (6) identifies the pairwise relationships involving areas assigned to
    the same region. Constraints (7) and (8) impose variable integrity.


    The NMPR adds the following constraints to the original max-p-regions model. Constraint (9) allows a region k to become
    a corridor region if at least one of its areas intersects an edge of the network. A link bk_ij indicates that both areas
    i and j belong to a corridor region k. However, because of the form of the discount function, the activation of link bk_ij
    can imply both a decrease in the objective function (when the areas are close to a road, i.e., a positive discount function),
    or an increase in the objective function (when the areas are far from a road, i.e., a negative discount function). Because
    all the bk_ij links between areas belonging to a corridor region are activated, a region is declared a corridor region
    when the total effects of the discount function lead to a positive value of the third term in the objective function.
    Constraints (10) and (11) activate all the bk_ij links between areas belonging to the region, but they act in different
    situations: constraint (10) controls the appearance of bk_ij links with a positive discount value by requiring that bk_ij
    links are only accepted when both areas belong to a corridor region. In contrast, constraint (11) forces the opening of
    those bk_ij links with a negative discount value; it mandates that these bk_ij links be opened when areas i and j are
    assigned to the same corridor region. Finally, constraints (12) and (13) impose variable integrity.


    To illustrate how the NMPR model works, examples of the max-p-regions and the NMPR models are provided in the original
    text. The presence of the road in the NMPR model has a direct effect on the shape of the regions. The NMPR model places
    a corridor region along segments of the road network in areas. The other regions are max-p-regions.


    Computational experiments with GUROBI on instances with different sizes and thresholds illustrate the complexity of this
    NP-hard problem and the convenience of using heuristic approaches to solve large instances.'

  content: 'This stage generates a large number of initial feasible solutions at random with different numbers of corridor
    regions and max-p regions. The procedure consists of four steps: area filtering, adaptive region formation, partition
    ranking and filtering, and enclaving.


    Area filtering

    In this phase, the areas become regions by themselves when li ≥ threshold. If an area intersects the road network, it
    is categorized as a corridor region; otherwise, it becomes a max-p region.


    Adaptive region formation

    This phase builds upon the seeded regions strategy first proposed by Vickrey (1961), which is widely used in the context
    of regionalization (Thoreson and Liittschwager 1967, Openshaw 1977, Rossiter and Johnston 1981, Duque et al. 2012). This
    method selects an area at random and grows a region around it. The algorithm starts with areas that intersect the road
    network to generate corridor regions. During the growing process, a region can change from a corridor to a max-p region
    if this benefits the objective function. This phase is completed when it is not possible to grow new feasible regions.
    The remaining unassigned areas are called ‘enclaves’ (Duque et al . 2012).


    Partition ranking and filtering

    At this point, the method has yielded n partial solutions. Each partial solution generates a given number of regions.
    This stage creates a set P of partial solutions with the maximum number of regions (the other partial solutions are discarded).


    Enclaving

    This stage takes each partial solution in P and transforms it to a feasible solution by assigning the enclave (unassigned)
    areas to an existing region. This process is based on the greedy-based assignation process, AssignEnclaves, devised by
    Duque et al . (2012). As with the max-p-regions model, the random component in this stage (specifically in the Adaptive
    region formation step) is a key feature to guarantee proper exploration of the solution space. Because the number of regions
    (p) is determined in this stage, it is important to generate a large number of initial feasible solutions to increase
    the possibility of finding a large number of regions.'

  content: 'The local search algorithm iteratively modifies an initial feasible solution by moving areas from one region to
    a neighboring region. This type of move was first applied by Nagel (1965) and is widely utilized in the literature. Duque
    et al . (2007) summarized other types of moves.


    To guarantee a good exploration of the solution space, we provide the local search with the following features: first,
    the candidate areas that move between regions are selected at random. Second, we use a local Tabu search that allows temporary
    worsening of the objective function as a strategy to escape from local optimal solutions. When an area is swapped from
    one region to another, the area–region relationship is altered; a corridor region could become a max-p region or vice
    versa. Finally, a unique feature of the Tabu search within the context of the NMPR problem regards local movements that
    modify a region intersecting the road network; these force the algorithm to evaluate the objective function under two
    scenarios, corridor and max-p regions, for both the donor and the recipient regions.


    The Tabu search procedure maintains the best solution Sb and the current solution Sc. Candidate moves contain all moves
    that will not break the spatial contiguity constraints. These moves are computed using the inner border areas across all
    regions in the partition. Sd is the temporary best solution from applying a move, and it is chosen if it is not in the
    Tabu list and if it is better than Sc. convTabu and tabuLength are the two Tabu search parameters used to control the
    stop condition and the length of the Tabu list.'

  content: 'The simulated areas were retrieved from sample data in the ClusterPy library for regionalization research (Duque
    et al . 2011a). The data include three datasets with different numbers of areas (n = 529, n = 1024, and n = 2025). The
    attribute value for each area is generated using a spatial autoregressive process with ρ = 0.9. The attribute for the
    threshold constraint follows a uniform distribution of [10, 15] (https://code.google.com/p/clusterpy/). A network dataset
    with 16 edges was designed over the grid areas.


    One heuristic solution example for the dataset with n = 1024 used parameters: threshold = 500, number of initial solutions
    = 10,000, TABU length = 85, MaxDisc = 0.3 and MaxDist = 10. Corridor regions are marked in dark grey.


    To quantitatively assess how MAX_DIST and MAX_DISC affect the results, two measures are proposed: the number of corridor
    regions, Nc, and the average corridor region compactness, C̄. These are defined as follows:


    C̄ = (1/Nc) sum_{R in Rc} cR


    where Rc is the set of corridor regions of the partition and cR = (sum_{j in R} si,Oi / NR - smin) / (smax - smin) is
    the compactness of a particular corridor region. cR is a standard measure with the range [0, 1]. smin and smax are the
    minimum and maximum values of all the area-closest-edge distances.


    A series of experiments was performed on a dataset with n = 529 to evaluate the impacts of MAX_DIST and MAX_DISC. The
    other parameters were set as follows: threshold = 110, number of initial solutions = 10,000, and TABU length = 85.


    Results emphasize that MAX_DIST has major effects. For a given value of MAX_DISC, both C̄ and Nc increase with MAX_DIST.
    As MAX_DIST grows, the discount function has a positive sign over a greater portion of the map, which implies a reduction
    in the objective function via the third term. Thus, the capacity for constructing corridor regions is higher. The speed
    of growth slows as MAX_DIST approaches a threshold and then stabilizes. This indicates that the measure has reached a
    threshold where no further benefit can be gained through the third term with larger values of MAX_DIST. The same rationale
    applies to the compactness measure: small MAX_DIST values force the corridor regions to be very close to the road (i.e.,
    they become more elongated). Conversely, larger MAX_DIST values force areas far from the road to become part of a corridor
    region. Again, there is a certain point after which MAX_DIST produces no more benefits in terms of the objective function
    value.


    MAX_DISC does not differ significantly for a given value of MAX_DIST but remains relatively stable. This suggests that
    in real applications, what matters is how far from the road we extend the premium for corridor regions (i.e., MAX_DIST).
    Given the linearity of the discount function, it is straightforward for practitioners to relate MAX_DIST to the parameters
    in domain-specific problems.


    To illustrate the solution quality of the heuristic algorithm: for the same parameters, 1000 random solutions were generated
    (not improved by the heuristic algorithm). Then, 20 heuristic solutions were generated and compared with those random
    solutions. Because the number of regions dominates other terms in the objective value function, the random solutions and
    the heuristic solutions were generated for a fixed number of regions k. The histogram of the 1000 random solutions showed
    that the objective values of the heuristic solutions are clear outliers of low values against the histogram, which shows
    that the quality of the heuristic is reasonable.'

  content: 'Wuhan is a rapidly growing city and is the largest city in central China. Its modernization process is reflected
    by the expansion of the street network. By 2014, the total road length had reached 14,520 kilometers, with a road density
    of 180.85 kilometers per 100 square kilometers. By integrating these networks into the regionalization process, the NMPR
    formulation has practical implications because the development of the urban street network in Wuhan has led to greater
    accessibility among areas and rapid development along the streets.


    We use the Wuhan grid-level data with its main street network. There are 7,766 one-kilometer grids and 386 network edges.
    The population from the 2000 census was used as the aggregation variable, and the threshold was set to 100,000 people.
    The urban land use area was chosen as the heterogeneity variable. Urban land use is largely clustered in the center and
    scattered along the roads far from the center. Some roads act as regional borders, such as the ring roads around the central
    area. Areas around the roads that expand outwards largely show similar attributes, regardless of their distance from the
    roads. The core of the city has a dense street network occupied by many urbanized areas.


    We ran both the max-p-regions and the NMPR models. The number of initial partitions was set to 200, the threshold value
    was 100,000 people, and the Tabu length was 85. For the NMPR formulation, MAX_DISC was set to a moderate value of 0.5,
    and MAX_DIST was set to 2 kilometers. The actual values of the parameters, including MAX_DISC, MAX_DIST and the threshold,
    should be based on physically meaningful values determined by practitioners.


    The max-p-regions procedure took 495.3 s to finish, while the NMPR procedure took 935.5 s. Both partitions generated 66
    regions, but the NMPR partition included 43 corridor regions. The result shows a clear pattern of corridor regions in
    the NMPR formulation. The corridor regions are largely aggregated in the urban center, where the street networks are also
    clustered. These areas are more likely to benefit from the formation of corridor regions, producing lower objective function
    values due to a higher value of the third term.'

  content: 'The NMPR model is a novel approach to incorporate the street network structure into a regionalization problem.
    This is the first regionalization model that allows both corridor regions and max-p regions. The model would be useful
    in a wide array of applications, including land use planning, districting, and other areas within the domain of geographical
    information science. The NMPR model allows researchers and practitioners to explicitly take the structure of the street
    network into account, balancing the formation of corridor regions and regional heterogeneity.


    The MAX_DIST parameter in the objective function affects the formation and features of the corridor regions in a near-logarithmic
    fashion. MAX_DIST influences the partitions through the objective function in a linear way. Compared to more complex measures,
    such as the tortuosity of network segments, it is a simple parameter; however, it performs surprisingly well. Parameter
    analysis reveals the bounded characteristics of this parameter, which could serve as guidelines for practitioners to modify
    it.


    This study assumes a homogeneous network and only considers geometric network properties. Future work could investigate
    stricter formulations for the network. For example, an additional restriction could be that edges in a corridor region
    must be a connected subnetwork. In addition, the street structure contains rich semantic information, including rank,
    capacity, and traffic load. These attributes can be integrated into the objective function.


    This paper establishes a framework for network regionalization problems. The network structure is incorporated into the
    exact formulation without sacrificing its rigor, while the heuristic algorithms provide an efficient method for regional
    growth testing and solution optimization. Both the formulation and the heuristic can be transferred to other optimization
    problems. This would greatly facilitate the regionalization applications.'
