Functional Regions
Using a p-Regions
Problem Approach

Abstract
Various spatial data analyses have been used for the identification of functional regions.
Functional regions are identified by grouping many areal units into fewer clusters
to classify the areal units in terms of similar properties, as well as to constrain the
spatial contiguity of the areal units in each cluster. This article proposes a spatial
optimization model, called thep-functional regions problem, to solve a regionalization
problem by considering geographic flows. The magnitude of geographic flows, such as
journey-to-work, is widely considered a good indicator of functional relationships
between areas so that regionalization models incorporating various criteria, such as
the maximum intraregion flows or the total inflows from other units, may be used
to identify the p regions. We also propose an analytical target reduction approach to
enhance the model tractability in generating optimal solutions to large problems and
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimization model using journey-to-work
data from Seoul (South Korea) and South Carolina (the United States).

Introduction
The concept of functional regions provides a framework for investigating the struc-
ture of geographic space. A functional region is characterized by the agglomeration
of economic activities at a regional center that focuses people’s movements from the
surrounding vicinities or hinterland. The center in a functional region is often
referred to as a central place or central business district (CBD), the size of which,
in terms of economic activity, depends on the range of goods and services provided
(Berry and Garrison 1958). A functional region is generally described in terms of the
structure of spatial interactions, which helps delineate regions naturally by maximiz-
ing the difference between within-region and between-region interactions (Noronha
and Goodchild 1992). Thus, the pattern of geographic flows is viewed as an effective
indicator for understanding how people’s economic activities are structured over
space (Taaffe, Gauthier, and O’Kelly 1996). For example, daily commuting flows
are generally manifested in the spatial structure of urban activity: because popula-
tion flows represent the economic activities of regions, many zoning systems have
used flow data to design zones (see Masser and Brown 1975; Masser and Scheur-
water 1980; Rosing and ReVelle 1986; Noronha and Goodchild 1992; Alvanides,
Openshaw, and Duke-Williams 2000).
This article is motivated by the practica l and empirical need in geography and
planning to identify functional regions an d delineate their hinterland. Theoreti-
cally, a region may be composed of a single core functional unit and other units,
or the region can develop mul tiple centers as economic activities diversify and are
extended through the evolution of transpor tation systems. Functional centers may
serve as growth poles that structure chang es in labor markets and service areas in
urban systems (Coombes et al. 1979; Sch wanen, Deileman, and Dijst 2003). Find-
ing evidence of multiple functional centers is key to understanding central place
theory. The delineation of subregions with identified functional centers is usually
accomplished using the population size o f and spatial interactions among units
because the influential area of a labor market is formed according to the level of
access from the vicinity to the center (Be rry and Garrison 1958). These functional
regions can be captured at geographic scales ranging from CBDs within a city
(e.g., Song and Kim 2015) to daily urban systems at a national level (Green
1958; Coombes et al. 1979; van der Laan 1998; Schwanen, Deileman, and Dijst
2003).
Delimiting functional regions usually involves aggregating small areal units into
fewer clusters, which are usually based on spatial contiguity and maintaining similar
properties between the areal units in each cluster (Brown and Holmes 1971). More
formally, the problem can be defined as the identification of a set of p groups that
are aggregated into n areal units while optimizing a predefined objective function
with a given set of criteria or constraints. Objective functions can be formulated
to minimize the dissimilarity of areal units or to maximize their similarity. The cri-
teria for achieving the best representation may include contiguity, compactness, or
236 International Regional Science Review 38(3)
socioeconomic homogeneity (Hess et al. 1965; Morrill 1981; Williams 1995). In this
regard, the delimitation of functional regions can be directly interpreted as a special
case of the p-regions problem (Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011).
An important issue, from a planning perspective, is how to effectively formulate
the regionalization problem mathematically. Traditionally, location–allocation for-
mulations have been emphasized, beginning with Hess et al. (1965). The authors
applied location–allocation formulations to political districting problems because
the model structure of location–allocation problems is similar to that of regionaliza-
tion. All demands (from the areal units) are forced to be exclusively assigned to
facilities (centers) and the objective function is similarly prescribed based on spatial
efficiency, for example, the sum of distances (similarity) from areal units to centers
is minimized (Hess et al. 1965; Zoltners and Sinha 1983; Murray and Estivill-Castro
1998). However, the location–allocation approach does not always guarantee the
spatial contiguity of the regions (Mehrotra, Johnson, and Nemhauser 1998; Cova and
Church 2000). Recently, several researchers have included an explicit contiguity
requirement as a constraint in spatial regionalization optimization models (Shirabe
2009; Salazar-Aguilar, Rı´os-Mercado, and Cabrera-Rı´os 2011; Duque, Church, and
Middleton 2011). While the contiguity constraints have produced contiguous
regions in previous research, the location of a center in each region may not be struc-
tured. If a regionalization problem involves identifying urban or regional systems or
delimiting areas such as labor markets or commuting sheds, then the problem should
be formulated such that the functional centers of the regions in the solution is to be
determined. In addition, it is important to determine how many functional regions
exist in the regionalization problem. Although the determination of an ideal number
of regions or functional centers can be modeled as an endogenous process in an opti-
mization model, the computational complexity is high even for a problem with a
small numbers of areal units, often resulting in intractable solutions (e.g., see
Shirabe 2009; Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011). Alternatively, if intractability
is a problem, an appropriate number of regions can be determined by exploring all
solutions for p, which can be simply prescribed by explicitly formulating the con-
straints in the model.
Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to develop a spatial optimization
scheme to model thep-functional regionalization problem and to suggest an efficient
method for the exact solution of the problem. The proposed model simultaneously
determines a given number of functional centers and delimits their boundaries, while
explicitly incorporating contiguity constraints. The article begins with a review of
mathematical models for functional regionalization. The second section reviews
functional regionalization based on existing mathematical models. The third section
provides the model specifications for delimitating functional regions and the fourth
section presents the preliminary results of the model. The fifth section introduces an
efficient solution approach called analytical target reduction (ATR) to find an opti-
mal solution for larger sized regionalization problems. Concluding remarks are
made in the final section.

Background
A vast amount of literature on districting and regionalization exists in operations
research. Zoltners and Sinha (1983), Williams (1995), and Duque, Romas, and
Surin˜ach (2007) have written review articles in the field. Here, we focus on studies
on functional regionalization with contiguity constraints. Functional regionalization
was initially motivated by interest in spatial systems, urban structures, and related
regional policy and planning (e.g., Berry and Garrison 1958; Masser and Brown
1975). Functional regions are generally defined based on a greater magnitude of
interactions or connections among spatial units within a region than with units out-
side the region (Brown and Holmes 1971). Therefore, the delimitation of functional
regions involves the aggregation of small areal units into larger clusters based on
spatial interaction flows such as journey-to-work and interstate migration. In addi-
tion, spatial interactions are considered a proxy for the ‘‘functional distances’’ that
separate the areal units (Brown and Horton 1970). Early studies that used spatial
interactions to delimit functional regions include those by Brown and Holmes
(1971), Masser and Brown (1975), and Masser and Scheurwater (1980). Although
many conceptual principles were developed in these studies, the operational
approaches were restricted due to computational limitations on linear programming
at that point in time.
In general, the delimitation of functional regions can be considered a special type
of regionalization. A simple approach is to use conventional clustering or partition-
ing methods instead of formulating mathematical models (see Openshaw 1973; Mas-
ser and Brown 1975; Fischer 1980; Masser and Scheurwater 1980). Such methods
often require additional processes for ensuring the spatial contiguity of the outcome
regions (Openshaw and Wymer 1995). These regionalization methods have also
been extended to achieve compactness of the outcome regions (Hess et al. 1965;
George, Lamar, and Wallace 1997). Multiobjective models have also been devel-
oped (Wise, Haining, and Ma 1997), some of which contain constraints to ensure the
spatial contiguity of the outcome regions (e.g., Zoltners and Shinha 1983; Duque
2004). However, because the addition of constraints for spatial contiguity can dra-
matically increase the complexity of the problem, exact optimization solutions have
been limited in practice to small n cases. Alternatively, relaxed solution frameworks
can be considered if the locations of the centers are known (Shirabe 2009) or if the
seeds of regions can be prespecified (Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011; Salazar-
Aguilar, Rı´os-Mercado, and Cabrera-Rı´os 2011). Heuristic methods, such as greedy
algorithms (Openshaw 1977), simulated annealing, and Tabu search (Openshaw and
Rao 1995; Bozkaya, Erkut, and Laporte 2003; Bozkaya et al. 2011; Duque, Anselin,
and Rey 2012), are typically employed when global optimal solutions are unattain-
able because of the complexity of the model. However, heuristic approaches may
require contextual knowledge of the areas studied to achieve the best results.
As previously discussed, the main issues in functional regionalization include
(1) the objectives of the model relative to the spatial context being modeled, (2) spatial
238 International Regional Science Review 38(3)
contiguity, and (3) the tractability of the model in terms of providing an optimal
solution. The objective function of region alization problems is a critical compo-
nent of the model formulation. The objective function must reflect the spatial con-
text which is being modeled by the optimi zation process. The effectiveness of a
model is normally evaluated by the extent to which the regions identified by the
model have more socioeconomic attrib utes within a regional grouping than
between that group and other groupings (Gordon 1999; Cova and Church 2000;
Shirabe, 2009). For example, if a model is concerned with spatial efficiency in
delineating regions, then the objective fun ction can be formulated to minimize the
sum of all distances from the functional spat ial unit (i.e., the centroid of the spatial
units) to other spatial units within the r egion (Hess et al. 1965; Hess and Samuels
1971; Murray and Estivill-Castro 1998). B y contrast, if the model addresses spatial
interactions such as geogra phic flows, the goal is to focus on interregional dissim-
ilarity relative to the intraregional intensity of flows. The objective function is then
to maximize intraregional flows or to mini mize interregional flows to determine
the regionalization of the spatial units (Plane 1982; Rosing and ReVelle 1986;
Alvanides, Openshaw, and Duke-Williams 2000). Many studies have formulated
various types of objective functions, but fe w have discussed the implications of the
findings based on such objective functions. For example, many zoning process
models delineate political districts or tra ffic zones using socioeconomic data
(e.g., demographic attributes) and spatia l interactions (e.g., commuting flows).
Here, the concern is the interpretation o f where and why a particular geographic
area is identified as a functional center, as well as how well the model captures the
existing spatial context of the area being studied (Morrill 1981; Williams 1995). In
classical location theories, a region is characterized by a functional center (central
place), which possesses high- frequency interactions with and its hinterland (Chris-
taller 1966; Lo¨sch 1938). If functional centers a re the inflow-dominant units within
the delineated region, then these units should represen t an administrative unit, a
population center, or a service center that provides a major source of job opportu-
nities. By contrast, outflow-dominant un its can be characterized as residential or
suburban areas where people commute to selected functional centers (Yeates
1963).
Second, as a geographic criterion in regionalization problems, spatial contiguity
is regarded as an important condition for eliminating the possibility that a region is
made up of spatially discontinuous clusters. In general, a region consists of areal
units with homogenous characteristics and is distinguished from other regions. How-
ever, a region can be fragmented when there are strong interactions between distant
spatial units. For example, in air transportation, major passenger flows are often
formed among the dominant functional regions (i.e., hub cities) based on some hier-
archical structure, but the spatial units of a grouped region are not necessarily spa-
tially contiguous (Nystuen and Dacey 1961; Wheeler and Mitchelson 1989). In
contrast, if a region should be delineated based on geographic flows, such as com-
muting flows in ground transportation, then the delimitation process for the regions
Kim et al. 239
involves a contiguity restriction, and a functional center is nested within its sur-
roundings with no fragmentation (Berry and Garrison 1958).The process of identi-
fying the functional regions with contiguity can also be applied to administrative
boundaries. For example, metropolitan statistical areas are grouped as population
core areas surrounded by counties, which have social and economic ties that are
measured by commuting flows to workplaces (White House 2009). In this context,
the contiguity requirement is prescribed explicitly by a constraint in a regionaliza-
tion model (Garfinkel and Nemhauser 1970; Mehrotra, Johnson, and Nemhauser
1998; Duque, Romas, and Surin ˜ach 2007). From a modeling perspective, spatial
contiguity is often translated into a network tree generation problem to check the
validity of contiguity. Areal units and their adjacency relationships are expressed
as nodes and edges in terms of a graph, such that a region is verified as contiguous
only if there is at least one path connecting all the spatial units within the region or if
all the spatial units within the region are connected to the tree structure. However,
spatial contiguity is a challenging requirement because deriving an exact formula for
enforcing the contiguity of spatial units substantially increases the number of vari-
ables and constraints.
Spatial contiguity has been modeled using mixed integer programming (MIP) and
much effort has been expended on generating efficient constraints based on graph
theory. For example, Zoltners and Shinha (1983) proposed a set of constraints using
a tree structure to reflect the shortest path adjacency. The underlying logic was that
areal units in a region maintain their connectedness in a tree structure when arbitra-
rily chosen seed units of the region at the kth level are allocated to a seed of the
region when the predecessor of the seed, that is, a tree at the ( k/C0 1)th level, is also
allocated to the seed. Shirabe (2005, 2009) used flow-based contiguity constraints
to construct a flow-based network for each region. The constraints build p-parti-
tioned tree networks for a given number of areal units. Suppose a network is formed
for each region, after which a sink in the constraints becomes the root of a shortest
path tree. If a path has only one sink within a region and receives unit flows from the
other nodes (spatial units), then the region is contiguous. Although this prescription
can effectively reduce the number of variables and constraints, the model remains
limited to relatively small problems unless the number of sinks consisting of regions
is known a priori. Salazar-Aguilar, Rı ´os-Mercado, and Cabrera-Rı´os (2011) pro-
posed an integer quadratic programming model with subtour elimination constraints
that guarantee territory connectivity or contiguity. This model is based on the main
principle of first solving a relaxed version of the problem without contiguity con-
straints. If the solution contains subtours, then the appropriate subtour elimination
constraints are added, and the problem is solved again. This process is repeated until
a feasible solution is found. However, the obtained feasible solution may not be a
global optimum.
Third, a regionalization model, particularly when formulated in terms of MIP
with contiguity constraints, may be n on-tractable due to complexity. Duque,
Church, and Middleton (2011) have presented three strategies for ensuring
240 International Regional Science Review 38(3)
contiguity, along with the corresponding MIP models: (1) TreePRM, which adapts
subtour elimination breaking constraints similar to those given by Salazar-
Aguilar, Rı´os-Mercado, and Cabrera-Rı ´os (2011); (2) OrderPRM,w h i c hu s e s
ordered-area assignment variables to prevent cycles and ensure contiguity; and
(3) FlowPRM, which uses unit flow constraints similar to those given by Shirabe
(2005, 2009). Each strategy has its own distinct strengths in solving problems, but
any p-regions problem that is formulated in the form of MIP belongs to a class of
NP-hard problems, which means that the solution is ensured only for a limited
number of spatial units regardless of th e type of contiguity constraints. Any MIP
model containing a set of constraints related to tree-, order-, or flow-based struc-
tures quickly reaches non-tractability with a small increase in the number of con-
straints and decision variables. For example, the model FLOWPRM,w h i c hi s
formulated based on Shirabe’s model (2005), is known to be the smallest model
in terms of the number of constraints, but the computational effort required using
commercial optimization software reveal s that the model is tractable with optim-
ality only for fewer than twenty-f ive units with a given level of p (for further
details, see Duque, Church, and Middle ton 2011). The difficulty may be due to
the constraints that are imposed to prevent cycles when partitioned trees of each
region are formed. A method for prespecifying the seeds of the regions (i.e., the
initial target seeds) in the model may be int roduced to improve the model’s tract-
ability by reducing the complexity of th e model through reducing the search
space of the p-regions problems (Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011). However,
such an approach can be validated only when the areas to be districted are known
a priori. For this reason, many researchers have used efficient heuristics to solve
large problems in practice by sacrificing the assurance of global optimality (e.g.,
Duque, Anselin, and Rey 2012).
Problem Specification
Formulating the p-functional Regions Problem (PFRP)
Many districting or regionalization pro blems focus mainly on constructing dis-
tricts or regions by grouping basic areal units without necessarily identifying the
regional center. However, this article proposes a PFRP, in which functional centers
are determined simultaneously with con tiguous functional regions. The basic
structure of the PFRP combines the principle of location–allocation models with
the contiguity constraints inspired by Shi rabe (2009) and Duque, Church, and Mid-
dleton (2011). As discussed, the location–allocation approach has been widely
adopted in modeling districting problem s because the basic areal units or demands
are exhaustively and exclusively assigne d (see Hess et al. 1965; Zoltners and Sinha
1983; Murray and Estivill-Castro 1998), w hich is essential for identifying centers
of regions within a set of flow-based contiguity constraints. The following notation
is used in the PFRP:
Kim et al. 241
i ¼ index of basic spatial units ; i ¼ 1; ... ; n; 2 I;
k ¼ index of spatial units selected as functional centers of the region ; k ¼ 1; ... ; n;
p ¼ the number of regions to be districted;
cij ¼ 1; if spatial units i and j are adjacent
0; otherwise;
/C26
Ni ¼ jjcij ¼ 1
/C8/C9
; a set of spatial units that are adjacent to i;
aik ¼ the amount of geographic movement from spatial unit i to regional center k:
The following decision variables are included in this model:
yik ¼ 1; if spatial unit i is included in region k
0; otherwise;
/C26
wik ¼ 1; if spatial unit i is chosen as a sink of region k
0; otherwise;
/C26
fijk ¼ the amount of unit flow from i to j in region kðfijk /C21 0Þ:
Here, aik indicates the magnitude of the actual spatial interactions between the
basic areal units and the regional centers, such as commuting and migration, to
determine the functional regions, whereas fijk denotes the conceptual flows between
basic spatial units a contiguous region. Based on this notation and the corresponding
decision variables, the PFRP can be modeled as follows:

The objective function maximizes the spatial interactions from the assigned areal
units to a center within a region; the objective function is defined to capture the rela-
tionship between the center and its hinterlands instead of the relationship between all
the spatial units assigned to the region because the PFRP determines the functional
centers and delineates their sphere of influence simultaneously. Constraint (2)
ensures that each spatial unit i is assigned to only one region k. These constraints
require that all the spatial units are exclusively and exhaustively allocated to regions.
Constraint (3) dictates that a sink can be assigned to the region k only when the
spatial unit i is assigned to the same region. Constraint (4) requires that each region
contains only one sink. Constraint (5) states that the total number of sinks isp (p < n).
Constraints (4) and (5) together allow only p regions to be delimited. Constraints
(6) and (7) ensure that unit flows can exist between the spatial units i and j if and
only if both units are adjacent to and assigned to the same region k. The contiguity
requirement for regionalization is established by constraint (8), which enforce the
unit flows between the areal units assigned to the same region. If the areal unit
i is not a sink (wik ¼ 0), the areal unit i must supply at least one unit flow. If the areal
unit i is a sink, the sink can have a nonnegative net flow up to (n /C0 p /C0 1). Here ‘‘n /C0
p /C0 1’’ represents the largest number of areal units that can be assigned to a region.
Constraints (9) and (10) impose integer restrictions on the location and allocation
decision variables. Constraint (11) ensures that fijk is nonnegative.
Although the PFRP has a similar structure to the models of Shirabe (2009) and
Duque, Church, and Middleton (2011) from a modeling perspective, there are
several important differences. First, the objective function constructs p regions by
maximizing the spatial interactions from the areal units to a functional center within
a region without violating the contiguity requirement. Most minimization models do
not necessarily require the number of regions to be specified, whereas the PFRP
requires that p is explicitly specified as a constraint (see constraint [5]) because the
PFRP is a maximization model. The similarity of this constraint to FLOWPRM may
appear trivial, but combining this constraint with constraints (2), (3), and (4) narrows
the solution space. The computational difficulty is thus reduced. The second differ-
ence between the PFRP and other models is that the former locates the functional
centers through the term wik. Figure 1 shows that the decision variables wik in the
PFRP function differently in finding a solution for p ¼ 3 compared to the same
Kim et al. 243
variables in other models, for example,FLOWPRM. The index k denotes an areal unit
that is selected as a functional center. By contrast, in other models, k indicates the
number of p-partitioned regions that are imposed as ordered numbers ( k ¼ 1, 2,
3, ... , p; see Shirabe 2009; Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011). The index k
in wik in the PFRP ranges from 1 to n, instead of from 1 to p, because the model
should select p centers from n areal units, as well as delineating the boundaries of
the p regions. If k has a value between 1 and p, then the PFRP cannot track the loca-
tion of a region’s functional center. The main rationale of this treatment is to identify
the sink and the functional center for each region during the regionalization process.
This notational treatment allows the variablewik to be interpreted in a different man-
ner in the PFRP. For example, w9_2 ¼ 1 in Figure 1 indicates that areal unit 9 is
selected as a sink where all unit flows come together from all areal units within a
region centered on areal unit 2. By contrast, comparable variables in other models
usually represent areal unit 9 as a sink of the second delineated region among p
regions. The variables w19_19 and w23_23 (¼1) indicate that areal units 19 and 23 are
both functional centers and sinks for a region. Note that the selected functional center
in the PFRP is not necessarily identical to the sink of the unit flow in each region
because constraint (8) determines the sink of a region among the areal units in the
region. In addition, considering that the goal of the objective function is to designate
the selected spatial unit k as the functional center that maximizes spatial interactions
from other areal units i within a region, the selected spatial unitk represents a central
Figure 1. Unit flows in optimal solution for p ¼ 3.
244 International Regional Science Review 38(3)
place or business center (i.e., a CBD) where geographical flows from other centers are
highly concentrated.
The logic of the PFRP in aggregating areal units into a set of functional regions
can be explained by determining the dominant flows of the geographic inflows, out-
flows, and intraflows. As illustrated in Figure 2, if an areal unit (unit 8 in Figure 2a)
receives substantial inflows from other units with small outflows, then this inflow-
dominant unit is very likely to be the region’s functional center. By contrast, if an
areal unit has dominant outflows to some vicinity (Figure 2b), then this areal unit
is likely to be part of the region’s hinterlands. As a special case, if an areal unit has
substantial intraflows with small inflows and outflows (Figure 2c), then the areal
unit is considered a self-sustaining region that is not included in any other region.
The main characteristic of the daily commuting flow is that geographic proximity
in journey-to-work flows is a critical factor in delineating the space of economic
activities and that most job opportunities are usually more accessible in a central
areal unit that acts as a functional center and whose influential space diminishes with
distance (Kim et al. 2012).
Results: Seoul Case Study
Data
We apply the PFRP to Seoul, South Korea. We consider Seoul for several reasons.
First, the number of spatial units is appropriate for examining the solvability of p-
regions problems. Seoul consists of twenty-five wards (‘‘gu’’ in Korean). From pre-
vious research, an optimal solution is difficult to find in most districting models for a
problem size of more than twenty-five areal units; problems involving sixteen units

at a particular p level are often even harder to solve if there is a contiguity require-
ment in the model (Shirabe 2009; Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011). Second,
identifying functional regions in Seoul has been an important issue in geography,
regional science, and planning because since the 1970s, the city’s labor and housing
markets have changed, along with periodic changes in economic development plans.
Historically, Seoul has evolved from a single central region into multiple functional
regions over the last thirty years. Therefore, the regionalization of the city with an
appropriate number of regions has been recognized as a critical task, not only for the
effective administration and zoning of the city’s labor market but also for the stra-
tegic provision of Seoul’s transportation infrastructure (Song and Kim 2015).
However, few studies have employed mathematical models to district and identify
functional regions and their influential areas in terms of labor and services. To this
end, the PFRP results can facilitate the decision-making process in terms of desig-
nating current CBDs and subcenters of Seoul as new centers of economic activity.
For geographic flows, we consider the daily origin–destination commuting flows
among Seoul’s twenty-five wards for the year 2005. Figure 3 shows the spatial pattern
of total inflows (Figure 3a) and outflows (Figure 3b) for these twenty-five areal units.
Areal units 2 (Jung-gu, a conventional CBD), 23 (Gangnam-gu, a new CBD), and 19
(Yeongdeungpo-gu, a third CBD) are recognized as Seoul’s three major CBDs because
these areal units host many firms and thus receive substantial inflows from other areal
units. By contrast, areal units 11, 16, 20, 21, and 24 show dominant outflows. With rapid
advances in transportation systems and fluctuations in the housing market, these units
have been developed as traditional residential areas (Song and Kim 2015). This raises
the question of which units act as CBDs and how their influential boundaries can be deli-
neated in terms of economic service areas of each unit. Figure 3 shows the locations of

et al. (2012) who have identified the same CBDs in Seoul.

Computational Results
The test cases in this study, fromp ¼ 2t o p ¼ 23, are successfully solved with optim-
ality. To solve the different cases, we use a CPLEX 12.1 with Intel’s Xeon Quad
Core 3.2 GHz/3 GB RAM based on the Windows 7 operating system; the PFRP
results of the problem cases are visualized using ESRI ArcGIS 9.3. Figure 4 shows
the distribution of solution times for all cases to investigate the actual computational
effort needed to solve the PFRP. The worst computational performance for the PFRP
is observed at lower levels ofp (2, 3, and 4), taking approximately sixteen to twenty-
six hours; however, optimal solutions are found for the remaining 87 percent of the
cases in less than thirty minutes. In fact, 50 percent of the cases are solved in just a
few minutes. This indicates that the PFRP can outperform other models in practice
for moderate-sized regionalization problems regardless of the level of p.
Figure 5 shows the optimal locations of the functional centers and districted
regions for p ranging from 2 to 5. Here, we make the following observations. First,
given the flow patterns in Figure 3, the interactions between areal units may be influ-
enced by the behavior of commuters in Seoul who tend to live near CBDs to avoid a
long commute to work. Note that the locations of the functional centers identified by
the PFRP show how CBDs have emerged as Seoul has developed economically.
Figure 5a, for p ¼ 2, identifies Seoul as a city with two distinct functional centers:
(1) Jung-gu (unit 2), a conventional CBD, and (2) Gangnam-gu (unit 23), a newly
established CBD. At p ¼ 3, another regional CBD, Yeongdeungpo-gu (unit 19) is
added to the western region of Seoul by dividing the area covered by Gangnam-gu
at p ¼ 2. The areal unit 19 is currently recognized as a subfunctional center in the
southern region of Seoul, which is consistent with this districting result. Note that the
major residential regions (units 11, 16, and 24) shown in Figure 3b are nested within
the three CBDs. At p ¼ 4 and 5, the spatial units 16 and 25, respectively, are newly

added, implying that these spatial units emerge as subfunctional centers from previous
regionalization results, whereas the conventional CBD (unit 2) maintains its dominant
position as a CBD regardless of the level of regionalization. This result suggests that
labor markets become fragmented through the emergence of multiple centers.
Second, regarding computational aspects, the inclusion relationship between
selected sets of centers is observed at different levels of p. In addition, a set of opti-
mal solutions for functional centers at p /C0 1 is found as a nested set of functional
centers at p, or functional centers at a specific level of p can be a predefined set
at p /C0 1. Table 1 implies that the optimal locations of the regional centers at p ¼
2 (centers 2 and 23) are included at p ¼ 3 and that the set of functional centers at
p ¼ 3 becomes part of the optimal locations at p ¼ 4. In other words, an optimal
solution at p becomes a candidate set of centers at lower levels of p (p /C0 1,
p /C0 2, ... , and 2). In the test cases, this inclusion relationship is observed from
p ¼ 2t o p ¼ 20, with increasing p, in all cases except at p ¼ 15. The nested-set rela-
tionship can be used to predict which units are potential candidates for functional
centers. This characteristic motivates a potential solution strategy that may guaran-
tee global optima based on the optimal solutions that are identified at a selected level
of p. As indicated by the three columns on the right-hand side of Table 1, there is
Figure 5. Optimal solutions of Seoul ( p ¼ 2–5).
248 International Regional Science Review 38(3)
some computational difficulty associated with finding optimal solutions of the PFRP
at lower levels of p. If any case with a lower p value suffers from computational
complexity, then the search for the optimal solution at p can be initiated from the
optimal solution sets at a higher level of p because the elimination of any candidates
can tighten the solution space and thus help ensure global optima.
Third, an ideal number of regions for delimiting the functional regions can be
determined based on changes in the objective values. As summarized in Table 1, the
objective value increases with p, indicating that the efficiency of the spatial interac-
tions increases as regions are more regionalized in the model. Furthermore, the
results in Figure 6 suggest that increments in the objective values with p may indi-
cate natural breaks for effectively delimiting the functional regions. Significant
changes are observed when p changes from 3 to 4 and 5 to 6, indicating that an ideal
regional district corresponds to p ¼ 3o r p ¼ 5 in the case of Seoul. As discussed in
the previous section, the regionalization process in Seoul during the last three
decades is well represented by both districting results.
For p ¼ 3, the three CBDs reflect the mid-2000s, when the southern and northern
regions of Seoul developed as distinct economic areas, and the southern region was
divided into two functional districts, namely functional centers 23 (a new CBD) and
19 (the third CBD; Song et al. 2012). As long as regions are districted in a nested struc-
ture with an increase in p, a discussion on the hierarchy of p regions is possible. For
example, atp ¼ 5, spatial units 2 and 23 are the top-tier centers, followed by spatial unit

respectively. Based on central place theory, these regionalization patterns indicate ser-
vice areas or hinterlands for thep-functional centers, as well as the regional hierarchy.
Application to a Larger Problem: ATR
Model Behavior of the PFRP
Table 1 seems to suggest that the model can solve a set of more than twenty-five areal
units. In general, givenn areal units, computational time rapidly decreases as the num-
ber of p regions increases. Large computational times are only observed for lower lev-
els of p with a higher level of complexity in terms of the numbers of constraints and
variables. Thus, large computational times may be a problem if exact solutions are
required at those levels. In terms of the model structure, note that constraints (6),
(7), and (8) include the constant ( n /C0 p), which dictates the maximum number of
allowable areal units constituting a region. In other words, a decrease in p increases
the value of the constant, implying that the possibility of unit flows among the
assigned spatial units also increases. In addition, an increase inp increases the objec-
tive value because most areal units have intraflows that far exceed the maximum out-
flows. In contrast, a decrease in p allows the intraflows of many areal units to be
substituted for the largest, second largest, or third largest outflows.
As noted earlier, an interesting observation from Table 1 is that the set of centers
selected at p /C0 1 is a subset of centers obtained for the range ofp. This observation is
Figure 6. Increments of objective values with p (Seoul). Note: The increment is calculated by
the difference in the objective value between at ( p /C0 1) and p.
250 International Regional Science Review 38(3)
due to the behavior of the objective function of the model. Basically, the model’s
objective function searches for potential centers from either (1) areal units receiving
large inflows from unselected areal units or (2) units with large intraflows. In theory,
areal units with relatively small intraflows or large outflows can be considered
potential centers. However, the model tends to designate areal units as potential cen-
ters if there are substantial differences between the magnitude of the intraflows and
that of the largest (hereafter referred to as DIFF1) or second largest (hereafter
referred to as DIFF2) outflows from a unit. These differences represent the impact
on the objective value when a spatial unit is assigned to a center instead of being
selected as a center. If only DIFF1 and DIFF2 are considered in the model, then the
model has similar characteristics to the Nystuen–Dacey model in which centers are
determined only by dominant flows from other nodes. However, note that the con-
tiguity requirement of the model restricts the center to be within delimited regions.
As a result, regions cannot be organized in a nonplanar type of hierarchy.
This behavior of the model rarely changes when the level of p decreases or
increases. The results indicate that it is very unlikely that areal units that are not
selected as potential centers at p are selected as centers at p /C0 1. Using hypothetical
data with six spatial units, Figure 7 and Table 2 show conceptually and in detail how
the PFRP functions in determining the locations of centers and assigning unselected
areal units to the centers. As an initial step in understanding the behavior of the
model, DIFF 1 and DIFF 2 are calculated by subtracting the largest and second larg-
est outflows, respectively, of an areal unit from its intraflows (see Table 2). For p ¼
5, areal unit 6, which has the smallest effect (25) on the objective value in terms of
DIFF1, maximizes the objective function when areal unit 6 is assigned to areal unit
5. Similarly, for p ¼ 4, spatial unit 2, for which DIFF1 corresponds to the second

smallest effect, becomes a unit to be dropped from a set of candidate centers atp ¼ 5
and is assigned to center 1. Districting three regions is more complicated because the
contiguity constraint must be considered. For p ¼ 3, although areal unit 5 has the
third smallest effect after units 2 and 6, areal unit 5 is already grouped with unit
6. If unit 5 is assigned to unit 3, then unit 6 is assigned to unit 3 or 4 based on con-
tiguity. If unit 5 is assigned to 3 and unit 6 is assigned to 4, then the decrement in the
objective value is 80 (5 ! 3:40; 6 ! 4: 40). Alternatively, if both units 5 and 6 are
assigned to unit 3, then the objective value decreases by 75 (5 !3: 40; 6 ! 3: 35),
corresponding to a better grouping. However, the best case is found when assigning
units 2, 4, and 6 to units 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This assignment results in the min-
imum decrement (55), thus maximizing the objective value. Finally, when a similar
process is applied to p ¼ 2, the maximum objective value is found once unit 2 is
assigned to center 1 and units 4, 5, and 6 are grouped around center 3.
ATR
Based on this hypothetical example and the empirical experiment, we propose the
ATR method to solve p-regions problems for a larger number of areal units. At a
given p level, the global optimal or near-optimal solutions are found by considering
the solution set found at the p þ q level, rather than for all combinations of areal
units (n) with functional centers. Here, q represents the ATR step size where 1 /C20
q /C20 (p /C0 1). ATR is based on the principle that the areal unit with the smallest con-
tribution to the objective value during the delimitation of p regions is likely to have
the smallest impact on the objective value when delineating (p /C0 q) regions. Further,
the centers that are selected at a level p are likely to be selected as centers at a lower
level. This suggests that unselected areal units in the p-regions problem can be
reasonably excluded from a set of potential centers when solving the (p /C0 q)-regions
problem.
ATR proceeds by the following steps. First, thep ¼ (n /C0 q) case is solved. In this
step, the set of potential seeds is I (|I| ¼ n). The procedure can be started at an inter-
mediate level of p, that is, with a high q value, but a relatively high q value may
require significantly longer computation times. Second, unselected spatial units are
eliminated from the set of potential centers and are added to the set of assigned spa-
tial units U. Third, two additional constraints, (12) and (13), restrict the areal units in
U to be centers and sinks for the next ATR case:
yij ¼ 0 8i; j 2 U ; ð12Þ
wij ¼ 0 8i; j 2 U : ð13Þ
Fourth, the previous steps are repeated until p ¼ 2o r p < q is reached. This
approach has considerable benefits because the complexity of the problem decreases
significantly from nCp to pC(p/C0 q) at the location level. The complexity of the
Kim et al. 253
allocation level decreases because of the narrowed search space at a given location
level, although the contiguity structure among the areal units may influence the solu-
tion efficiency for a particular case. It should be noted that although a lower q value
requires less computational effort in finding the optimal solution, the probability of
finding the global optimum increases, along with the solution time, as the value ofq
increases.
The performance of ATR can be improved by considering another important
factor from Tables 1 and 2. Note that some areal units are consistently selected as
functional centers regardless of the p level. In general, such units (denoted as the
set S) have substantial intraflows (self-sustaining spatial units) or inflows from other
areal units. An areal unit with dominant inflows from other units can be regarded as a
functional center. Thus, the solution space can be reduced and the computational
efficiency improved by considering one or two areal units as centers regardless
of the p level. Applying this concept to ATR requires the following constraints
(14) and (15):
yii ¼ 1 8 i 2 S; ð14Þ
wii ¼ 1 8 i 2 S: ð15Þ
Finally, note that the exception that is observed at p ¼ 15 in Table 1 may occur
when ATR is applied with q ¼ 1. This exception occurs under three conditions:
(1) the largest outflows of an areal unit are to a center that is not adjacent to the areal
unit (which is defined as the first law of geography), (2) no unit flow route is ensured
from the areal unit to the center, and (3) areal units that similarly impact the objec-
tive value are distributed around the center. This problem can be resolved using a
higher q value.
Table 3 demonstrates how ATR models are more effective compared to the orig-
inal model. An ATR model substantially reduces the computational time for all
cases, without losing optimality. The longest computational time is less than five
minutes, with most cases requiring only 1 percent of the solution time of the original
model. In addition, the ATR model shows a 99 percent reduction in the number of
iterations relative to the original model. Not surprisingly, these results are due to sig-
nificant reductions in complexity at each location level, that is, the ATR model
selects p /C0 1 functional centers from p predetermined centers. Among the twenty-
two cases, the solution at p ¼ 14 is the only case in which a solution set is not cov-
ered by a set at the next higher level,p ¼ 15 (q ¼ 1). Thus, the remaining twenty-one
cases (95.5 percent) are globally optimal solutions. If a more conservative approach
is required, then a higher q value can be used and computational times remain rea-
sonable. The third column of Table 3 (an ATR model with q ¼ 2) shows that all
solution sets are globally optimal and that t he longest computational time is only
16.9 minutes, which is only 1.6 percent of the computational time for the original
model. In addition, the ATR model reduces the number of iterations required by

mising approach for a large size problem when optimal solutions are desired. This
approach is particular applicable to regionalization problems involving spatial
interactions such as migration and co mmuting with a short-distance tendency
(Ravenstein 1885; Tobler 1987) or interactions derived from the central place the-
ory (Christaller 1966).
Application of ATR: South Carolina Case Study
Here, we test the PFRP model by incorporating ATR for a large data set, namely
forty-six counties in South Carolina using journey-to-work data from the 2000 US
Census. As with the previous p-regions models, the MIP version of the PFRP is
limited to a set of approximately twenty-five areal units for solving the problem with
optimality. Thus, we apply ATR to assess its impacts on the solution capability of
the original PFRP. To predetermine the initial seeds, Figure 8 provides the spatial
pattern of interactions among the forty-six counties in terms of intraflows and
inflows, which are used as a reference when adding constraints (14) and (15). Two
counties (Greenville and Richard) show dominant intraflows (Figure 8a) as well as
inflows. In contrast, there are several counties in the southwestern and northern areas
that show minimal intraflows and/or inflows (Figure 8b). Intuitively, these small
counties are clearly not likely to be functional centers, whereas the two counties with
dominant intraflows are.
Table 4 shows the computational results obtained for the PFRP by applying ATR
with q ¼ 1 sequentially from p ¼ 44 to p ¼ 2. Because the optimal functional centers
are identified at each p, those units that are not selected as functional centers at the
p /C0 1 level are excluded using constraints (11) and (12). As a result, optimal solu-
tions for thirty-six cases (84 percent) are derived for p =9t o p = 44, for which the
computational time ranges from several seconds to a few hours. Note that seven
cases are terminated due to memory problems, with a gap ranging from 3.78 percent
to 41.7 percent. However, despite the gap, the objective values are global optima,

which are verified through enumerations for p ¼ 2 – 8. Note also that most of the
excluded spatial units are counties with minimal intraflows or inflows from other
counties, whereas the top ten counties (10, 34, 4, 22, 46, 2, 24, 41, 25, and 1) satisfy-
ing these criteria remain in the set of potential centers until the sequential process
reaches p ¼ 9.
Figure 9 demonstrates that ATR is appropriate, not only for the PFRP but also for
other districting model variants. As expected, atp ¼ 3, South Carolina is simply dis-
tricted with three regions centered at Greenville, Richard, and Charleston counties,
which have the three largest populations in South Carolina. At p ¼ 4, Horry county,
which ranks fourth in terms of intraflows, is added as a functional center by annexing
some neighboring counties from regions covered by Richland and Charleston. At
p ¼ 5 and 6, Spartanburg and Beaufort counties are added as regional centers. It
is noteworthy that these three counties show dominant intraflows but small inflows
and are grouped with only a few neighboring counties. This finding may indicate
that these counties are more self-sustaining regions than regions with functional cen-
ters in Greenville, Richard, and Charleston counties. The regional delimitation of
South Carolina can be explained using a combination of central location theory and
labor-shed regions. Not surprisingly, Richland County, which includes Columbia,

258 International Regional Science Review 38(3)
the capital of South Carolina, is a major functional center for administrative services.
The most populous counties, Greenville and Charleston, have experienced a rapid
population growth in conjunction with a corresponding increase in job opportunities.
The most appropriate level of p for regionalization can be identified from the varia-
tion of the objective function values with p. In Figure 10, the most significant incre-
ment in the objective function is clearly observed as p changes from 3 to 4,
indicating that the optimal number of regions is three. If more regions are consid-
ered, then five regions are reasonable because of an alternative natural break found
in the variation in the objective function values from p ¼ 5t o p ¼ 6. In terms of an
urban hierarchy, the first-tier consists of three centers (Greenville, Richard, and
Charleston counties), and the second-tier comprises Horry and Spartanburg counties
as subfunctional centers.
Concluding Remarks
This article considers a flow-based regionalization problem (PFRP) in terms of an
MIP formulation that determines p functional centers and aggregates n areal units
into p contiguous regions based on spatial interactions. This PFRP model is based
on classical location theory, which assumes that a region consists of functional cen-
ters that are often referred to as central places, urban centers, or CBDs, depending on
geographic scales, surrounded by a hinterland that is linked through spatial interac-
tion with the centers. Spatial interactions, including inflows, outflows, and intra-
flows, are key to transforming areal units into p-functional regions, where the
pattern of spatial interactions may represent an area of commuting or similar eco-
nomic flows. In our results, the PFRP only groups commuting flows among regions
with a set of functional centers. However, note the empirical observation that the

functional regions formed by a pattern of spatial interactions among regions, such as
commuting flows, are also governed by other political or economic activities.
There are three main differences between the PFRP presented here and other
p-regions models. First, the PFRP fundamentally belongs to a class of location–
allocation models with a contiguity requirement. The models in Duque, Church, and
Middleton (2011) and Shirabe (2009) are basically allocation models with explicit
contiguity requirements, but these models do not identify the significant areal unit
within each region. In contrast, the PFRP determines the locations of functional
centers by considering the magnitude of spatial interactions among areal units, while
also ensuring contiguity. Second, the PFRP is a maximization model for districting
regions. Most other p-regions models focus on minimizing dissimilarity as an objec-
tive function rather than maximizing similarity among spatial units. The PFRP gen-
erally maintains compact shapes because the mot flows, such as commuting, are
inherently dictated by physical distance, such that spatial contiguity is satisfied in
capturing the spatial pattern of commuting flows. Third, in terms of model perfor-
mance, the PFRP provides more efficient solvability than previous models. The
PFRP model can be applied to problems with up to thirty areal units with no addi-
tional constraints, which is sufficient to validate many regionalization problems with
optimality. Finally, the PFRP combined with ATR can be applied to relatively large
problems (e.g., forty-six counties in South Carolina).
From a planning perspective, ATR is useful for situations in which the decision-
making process requires that an appropriate level of p be determined. Although this
approach may not guarantee optimality in extremely complex cases, ATR is poten-
tially applicable to any p-regions problem with criteria involving geographical
movements among the regions, which is exemplified here in the cases of Seoul and
South Carolina. In particular, ATR is effective in reinforcing optimality for small or
moderate size problems if an exact solution is required. Obviously, ATR may have
limited applicability for a large number of areal units, which is still the main issue in
using a mathematical programming approach to solve regionalization problems. In
this regard, future research should be two-pronged. First, the suitability and effec-
tiveness of ATR should be evaluated for use with complex data sets, followed by the
development of heuristic techniques for practical applications (Duque, Romas, and
Surin˜ach 2007).
