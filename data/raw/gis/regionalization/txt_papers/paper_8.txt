Abstract
Quantum computing has shown significant potential to address
complex optimization problems; however, its application remains
confined to specific problems at limited scales. Spatial regional-
ization remains largely unexplored in quantum computing due to
its complexity and large number of variables. In this paper, we
introduce the first hybrid quantum-classical method to spatial re-
gionalization by decomposing the problem into manageable sub-
problems, leveraging the strengths of both classical and quantum
computation. This study establishes a foundational framework for
effectively integrating quantum computing methods into realistic
and complex spatial optimization tasks. Our initial results show a
promising quantum performance advantage for a broad range of
spatial regionalization problems and their variants.

1 Introduction
Quantum annealing [12] is an optimization technique inspired by
quantum mechanics, designed to solve complex optimization prob-
lems by exploring a vast solution space through quantum fluctua-
tions. Unlike its classical counterpart, simulated annealing [15] that
is based on thermal fluctuations, quantum annealing uses quantum
tunneling to escape local minima and potentially converge on the
global optimum. In recent years, the quantum annealing hardware
has been significantly advanced to support thousands of qubits,

5000 qubits [14]. However, current quantum systems remain con-
strained by notable technical limitations that limit solving problems
of large sizes. To address the scale challenge, quantum annealers
are supplemented by hybrid solvers that integrate classical CPUs
with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) at different phases. The
classical computer handles problem decomposition, setting initial
conditions, and refining results using well-established optimization
methods, while the QPU leverages quantum annealing with its
native QUBO-like formulations [11]. These solvers, such as DQM,
CQM, and NL solvers [8], can partition large-scale problems into
smaller sub-problems that are then solved with the QPU. Such
advances have enabled quantum computers to handle complex
optimization problems and enterprise-level applications [7].
Spatial regionalization is an essential and expensive spatial oper-
ation that serves many real-world applications in economics, urban
planning, and other domains requiring efficient spatial resource
allocation [2, 13, 17]. Regionalization aggregates spatial areas into
contiguous regions, aiming to minimize heterogeneity within each
region. Constrained by explicit spatial contiguity requirements,
spatial regionalization is proved to be NP-hard [ 13], and finding
optimal solutions remains computationally infeasible due to combi-
natorial complexity [3, 13, 17].
This paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical ap-
proach designed for seeding-based spatial regionalization. We de-
compose regionalization into smaller, quantum-processable sub-
problems and explore the solution space more effectively than the
traditional heuristic methods. Specifically, we decompose seeding-
based regionalization into two phases, spanning five stages, adapt-
ing a variation of our framework proposed in [4] for classical com-
puters. Then, the quantum annealing is leveraged to improve the
performance of two stages: seed selection and local optimization,
which are used by all seeding-based regionalization techniques.
Therefore, our proposed improvements are general and applicable
in various applications. Our initial empirical results on the D-Wave
quantum annealer show promising improvements in seed selec-
tion quality and local optimization runtime. Ongoing and future
explorations might exploit our quantum model in [6] for enforcing
spatial contiguity constraints, which are imposed by all regional-
ization techniques, to build a quantum-optimized region growing

stage. The rest of this paper introduces a brief background, dis-
cusses the related work, and presents our proposed approach and
initial empirical results.
2 Background
Quantum annealing (QA) has been proposed as a novel heuristic
to solve many of the well-known NP-hard problems [ 12], and it
is similar to Simulated Annealing (SA). In SA, a solution space is
explored by randomly proposing changes to the current solution. If
the new value of the objective function is decreased, the proposed
change is accepted. If the objective function increases, the change
is accepted with some probability according to the temperature.
In QA, these changes are applied on a quantum superposition of
the different solutions, allowing for a massively parallel search of
the solution space. This quantum parallelism, combined with the
quantum tunneling [6], facilitates fast exploration and potentially
avoids being stuck in local minima.
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). In
QA, the problem is represented as a QUBO formulation that con-
sists of a quadratic objective function over binary variables, while
any constraints are represented as penalty terms [11]. QUBO is an
optimization technique that is inherently similar to other opera-
tions research techniques and requires no or limited background
knowledge of the internals of the quantum annealing process from
a user perspective. Under the hood, the quantum annealer encodes
the QUBO formulation in the interactions betweenqubits, which are
the quantum counterpart of the classical binary bits. More details
about the quantum annealing process can be found in [6].
Hybrid quantum-classical computing. Although many opti-
mization problems can be formulated as QUBOs, the limitations
in the current quantum hardware, e.g., small size and low degree
of qubit connectivity, restrict the size and complexity of problems
that can be practically solved. This challenge is further amplified
in problems with many constraints, where encoding constraints as
penalty terms [11] often requires additional slack variables, con-
suming even more qubits. A widely adopted and practical approach
is integrating quantum annealers within a hybrid framework, com-
bining both classical CPU and quantum computing powers to solve
large problems efficiently using hybrid solvers. The core idea of a
hybrid solver is to decompose large or dense problems into smaller
subproblems that fit within the connectivity and size constraints
of the quantum hardware. In this framework, a quantum proces-
sor is paired with a classical heuristic in an iterative loop: the
quantum processor solves selected subproblems, while the classical
component manages orchestration, constraint handling, and post-
processing. By offloading constraint enforcement and much of the
solution space exploration to the classical side, hybrid solvers effec-
tively mitigate the challenges posed by sparse qubit connectivity.
D-Wave Quantum Inc., a leading provider of quantum annealing
hardware, currently offers four hybrid solvers tailored to different
problem types and variable domains: the Binary Quadratic Model
(BQM), the Discrete Quadratic Model (DQM), the Constrained Qua-
dratic Model (CQM), and the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver
(NL-solver) [8]. Notably, both CQM and NL-solver support the
explicit expression of constraints in a declarative form.
3 Related Work
Classical spatial regionalizationclusters a collection of spatial ar-
eas, i.e., polygons, into regions that are spatially contiguous and ho-
mogeneous with respect to one or more attributes [2–4, 10, 13, 17].
Numerous variants exist, for example, the p-regions problem takes
the number of regions p as user input, the max-p-regions prob-
lem automatically finds the maximum number of regions, whereas
the p-compact-regions problem emphasizes spatial compactness
of regions. All regionalization variants are NP-hard, so practical
solutions rely on heuristics to find approximate good solutions
for large data. The two major classes of classical solutions are:
(a) seeding-based regionalization and (b) graph-based region-
alization. Seeding-based regionalization techniques select seed
areas and build regions, i.e., clusters, around these seeds [ 4, 10].
Graph-based regionalization builds connected regions by working
directly on spatial adjacency graphs [10]. It includes both top-down,
e.g., SKATER, and bottom-up agglomerative techniques, e.g., RED-
CAP [10]. Over the past decade, it has been empirically shown that
seeding-based techniques have better scalability than graph-based
techniques, so they empower spatial data analysts to support large
datasets [2, 3, 13, 17]. However, classical heuristics are computa-
tionally extensive and prone to getting trapped in local optima,
making the search for high-quality solutions expensive. By using
quantum tunneling, quantum annealing can achieve high-quality
solutions faster. None of the existing techniques leverages quantum
annealing to address this NP-hard problem.
Quantum-based spatial clustering has emerged as a promising
tool for NP-hard clustering and partitioning problems. Mapping
spatial clustering to QUBO form is non-trivial, yet several stud-
ies show feasibility for related graph-partitioning tasks. Ushijima-
Mwesigwa [19] encodes modularity-maximizing community detec-
tion as a QUBO, with each node’s binary spin indicating community
membership. Negre [18] extends this to𝑘 communities on a D-Wave
2000Q, obtaining modularity scores comparable to leading classi-
cal algorithms. Arthur and Date [5] formulate balanced 𝑘-means
clustering as a QUBO, achieving clustering quality on par with
classical 𝑘-means and highlighting potential scalability benefits.
These proof-of-concept results illustrate that quantum annealing
can effectively handle clustering objectives, optimizing over assign-
ments of points to clusters in a manner that, in some cases, escapes
local minima that trap classical heuristics.
Quantum clustering studies omitted explicit enforcement for
spatial contiguity, as it requires a prohibitive number of qubits
and scales poorly with the problem size. They relied on adjacency
graph structures that implicitly encoded connectivity. Very recent
work addresses spatial contiguity directly [ 6] based on the dis-
crete quadratic model (DQM) [8]. However, none of the existing
quantum-based clustering approaches have addressed seeding spa-
tial regionalization, which is shown over the past decade to be
the most scalable class of spatial regionalization algorithms. Our
work is the first to explore seeding spatial regionalization on
quantum computers.
4 Quantum Spatial Regionalization
Spatial regionalization is an NP-hard clustering problem, so all exist-
ing algorithms use heuristic-based search to find good approximate
solutions rather than optimal solutions. Most existing seeding-based
Spatial Regionalization: A Hybrid Quantum Computing Approach SIGSPATIAL ’25, 978-1-4503-XXXX-X/2025/06
techniques work in two phases: (1) finding an initial solution, and
(2) optimizing the initial solution to output a final solution. Build-
ing on our previous work in [ 4], the first phase has four stages:
seed selection, region growing, enclave assignment, and constraint
adjustments. The second phase is one stage: local optimization that
employs heuristic search techniques to improve the approximate
solution quality, measured in regional heterogeneity.
We propose a hybrid approach that uses quantum annealing
to improve the seed selection and the local optimization stages,
while other stages are handled using efficient classical algorithms
as in [17]. These two stages have the highest potential to utilize the
quantum annealing advantages to improve the runtime or solution
quality. The seed selection is purely quantum-encoded. The local
optimization is an iterative hybrid loop: the CPU prepares a set of
potential region border areas, which the QPU then shuffles to refine
the solution. This ongoing work shows a preliminary, promising
exploration that will be further strengthened in future explorations.
The rest of this section describes each quantum-encoded stage.
4.1 Quantum Seed Selection
The seed selection stage takes 𝑛 spatial areas, i.e., polygons, as
input and finds 𝑝 spatially scattered seed areas to build regions
around. Scatteredness ensures seeds remain well-separated so that
subsequent regional growth is not squeezed together. We measure
scatteredness as the minimum pairwise distance between geometric
centroids of seed areas, as in [17], with the objective of maximizing
this scatteredness. Therefore, seed selection maps to a well-known
problem called the max-min dispersion [20]. To address the max-
min dispersion, we adopt a quantum-friendly formulation based on
the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) [9]. Given a set of 2D points
𝑉 , we first define a complete graph 𝐺 = (𝑉 , 𝐸) where each edge 𝑒𝑖 𝑗
is assigned a weight equal to the Euclidean distance 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 between
points 𝑖 and 𝑗. The MIS is a set of vertices where no two vertices in
the set are connected by an edge, and the set has the largest possible
size among all such sets in the graph. For a candidate minimum
(dispersion) distance threshold 𝑑𝑚, we construct a subgraph 𝐺 ′ =
(𝑉 , 𝐸′) by removing all edges with 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 > 𝑑𝑚. Solving the MIS on
𝐺 ′ yields a subset of points where all pairwise distances are at least
𝑑𝑚. If the MIS size is less than the required number of seeds 𝑝, 𝑑𝑚
is reduced; otherwise, it can be increased. A binary search over
feasible values of 𝑑𝑚 identifies the largest achievable dispersion.
We associate a binary variable 𝑥𝑖 with each spatial area, where
𝑥𝑖 = 1 if area 𝑖 is selected as a seed and 0 otherwise. The primary
objective is to maximize the number of seeds, which is equivalent
to minimizing the term −Í
𝑖 𝑥𝑖. To enforce the MIS constraint, we
introduce a penalty 𝜆MIS for any pair of connected seeds being
selected simultaneously. This results in the following objective
function:
𝑋 = −
∑︁
𝑖 ∈𝑉
𝑥𝑖 + 𝜆MIS
∑︁
(𝑖,𝑗 ) ∈𝐸′
𝑥𝑖𝑥 𝑗
Minimizing 𝑋 thus yields the largest possible set of seeds that are
all separated by at least the distance threshold 𝑑𝑚. This technique
is encoded as a BQM model [8]. For space limitations, our complete
BQM formulation is described in [1].
4.2 Quantum Local Optimization
The local optimization stage takes an initial solution of 𝑝 spatially-
contiguous regions as input, and outputs an optimized solution.
The optimized solution still consists of 𝑝 spatially-contiguous re-
gions but with lower regional heterogeneity. This stage is by far the
most time-consuming stage for all seeding-based regionalization
techniques, and it also determines the final objective function value,
i.e., heterogeneity. This makes it the best candidate to leverage the
quantum advantage for faster runtime and better objective value.
We employ quantum annealing to model a “swap-or-move” local
search technique that improves the initial solution by shuffling
border movable areas between neighboring regions. The goal is
minimizing an objective function representing the overallregional
heterogeneity while maintaining the spatial contiguity of each
region. By finding articulation areas using the classic method [17],
we can find all movable areas in linear time. The heterogeneity of
a region 𝑅 is defined as 𝐻𝑅 = Í
𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑗 ∈𝑅,𝑖< 𝑗 |𝐴(𝑎𝑖 ) − 𝐴(𝑎 𝑗 )| , for the
dissimilarity attribute 𝐴 of all pairs of areas 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑗 ∈ 𝑅. The overall
heterogeneity 𝐻 is the summation of heterogeneity of all the 𝑝
regions, i.e., 𝐻 = Í𝑝
𝑘=1 𝐻𝑅𝑘 , ∀1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑝. If an area 𝑎𝑖 moves from a
donor region 𝑅𝑑 to a receiver region 𝑅𝑟 , both 𝐻𝑅𝑑 and 𝐻𝑅𝑟 change,
and hence 𝐻 changes.
We employ a Constraint Quadratic Model (CQM) [8] to optimize
choosing area moves that improve the objective function 𝐻. It is
computationally expensive to aggregate the attribute 𝐴 over all
area pairs directly on a QPU due to an architectural limitation of
the qubits. To overcome this, we adopt an estimation strategy that
avoids full recalculation of 𝐻 by directly estimating the change in
heterogeneity (Δ𝐻 ) resulting from a move. The objective function
is modeled using key statistical attributes of a region 𝑅, its total
number of areas (𝑁𝑅), mean attribute 𝐴 value (𝑀𝑅), and attribute
𝐴 variance (𝑉𝑅), along with the value of attribute 𝐴𝑚 of a movable
border area 𝑎𝑚 ∈ 𝑅. These statistics are chosen for their computa-
tional efficiency, as they can be updated in linear or constant time
on a classic computer. The potential destinations for movable areas
serve as the model’s variables. By assuming the attributes of large
datasets are normally distributed, when a region adds or removes
an area, this change is estimated using its statistical properties:
Δ ˆ𝐻add = 𝑁𝑅 ·
√︁
V𝑅 + ( 𝑀𝑅 − A𝑚)2
Δ ˆ𝐻remove = −(𝑁𝑅 − 1) ·
√︁
V𝑅 + ( 𝑀𝑅 − A𝑚)2
Δ𝐻 = Δ ˆ𝐻add + Δ ˆ𝐻remove. By estimating Δ𝐻 for every potential
move, we can leverage quantum optimization to simultaneously
evaluate multiple relocations and select the combination that most
significantly reduces total system heterogeneity. To preserve spatial
contiguity, we impose a critical constraint: each region may either
donate or receive at most one area per iteration, but not both. This
constraint is necessary because moving an area can alter the set of
remaining movable areas and change the receivable areas of the
donor region.
The hybrid quantum local optimization stage executes multiple
iterations. Each iteration computes the list of movable areas using
the classical CPU. Then, the list is dispatched to the QPU to explore
multiple area moves using a CQM model to find a better solution.

For space limitations, our CQM formulation is detailed in [1].
5 Empirical Results
The proposed BQM and CQM models for seed selection and loca-
tion optimization, respectively, are implemented using Python 3.12
and constructed using the D-Wave Ocean toolbox ’dimod’ library
(version 0.12.14). We run our algorithms on an on-premise D-Wave
Advantage annealing quantum computer (housed at the USC Quan-
tum Computing Center) accessed via D-Wave’s Leap cloud APIs.
The current QPU has Pegasus P16 topology and provides ∼5000
superconducting flux-qubits, each is 15-way connected. We com-
pare our quantum algorithms versus the classical counterparts in
PRUC [17], setting its user threshold to zero and using the same
evaluation datasets. The default value of dataset size is 50 and
p is 10. All results are collected after 10 iterations of local opti-
mization. The relative improvement of runtime is calculated as
(𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑐 −𝑇𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑚
𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑐
× 100)%, and similarly for quality improvements.
Figure 1 shows initial results for the local optimization perfor-
mance. Figure 1a depicts the relative improvements, as percentages,
of our quantum local optimization versus the classical counterpart
in both runtime and quality, measured as the objective function
value (overall regional heterogeneity 𝐻). With increasing dataset
size (DS), the runtime improvement increases while the quality
improvement decreases. The quality improvement starts at 22.4% at
DS=50 and continuously decreases to 6.3% at DS=5k. This suggests
that quantum annealing keeps marginal improvements in solution
quality with increasing data sizes, yet it will not degrade the quality.
On the contrary, the runtime improvement continuously increases
from -191% (a slowdown) at DS=50 to 62.3% (a speedup) at DS=5k.
These results are confirmed in Figure 1b, which shows relatively
stable quantum runtime as data size increases. This shows a promis-
ing quantum advantage in terms of runtime speedup with larger
datasets. It worth noting that a dataset of all US counties has 3.2k
polygons, so 5k datasets are used in many practical applications.
Figure 2 shows initial results for the seed selection perfor-
mance. Figure 2a depicts the relative improvements, as percentages,
showing better runtime and quality improvements with increas-
ing 𝑝 value. However, the quantum runtime ranges from 300- 500
milliseconds compared to 3-7 milliseconds for the classical algo-
rithm for this small dataset size, so the increasing improvement
is not significant and must be tested on larger data sizes that our
preliminary model does not currently support. On the contrary, the
quality improvement, measured as the min seed distance, is signifi-
cantly improved to reach 46.5%. This is confirmed by the absolute
quality values in Figure 2b as larger 𝑝 makes it harder for classical
heuristics to optimize for many seeds, while the quantum annealer
can still explore a larger search space. This suggests a potential
quantum advantage in improving the seed selection quality.
6 Conclusion and Future Explorations
This paper has presented the first hybrid quantum approach to ad-
dress the spatial regionalization problem. The approach decomposes
the regionalization process into stages, and exploits the quantum
computing power for the two most promising stages, seed selec-
tion and local optimization. Two algorithms have been proposed
and realized using D-Wave’s BQM and CQM hybrid solvers. The
presented initial results suggest a potential quantum advantage to
improve the objective function quality of seed selection and the
runtime efficiency of the local optimization. More explorations are
ongoing to improve the models in terms of scalability, more effec-
tive heuristics, and support richer variants of spatial regionalization
problems. Future extensions can use our quantum model to enforce
spatial contiguity [6] towards a quantum region growing stage.

Appendix
A BQM in Seed Selection
The seed selection stage is modeled as a max-min dispersion prob-
lem, which we solve by repeatedly finding the Maximum Indepen-
dent Set (MIS) in a graph. We solve this by employing a quantum-
assisted binary search to find the largest possible minimum distance
(𝑑𝑚) that allows for a valid selection of 𝑝 seeds.
Variables. Let 𝑉 = {𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛 } be the set of spatial areas.
We define a binary variable for each area:
𝑥𝑖 =
(
1 if area 𝑎𝑖 is selected as a seed
0 otherwise
Objective Function. For a given minimum distance threshold
𝑑𝑚, we construct a graph 𝐺 ′ = (𝑉 , 𝐸′) where edge (𝑖, 𝑗 ) ∈ 𝐸′ if
𝑑′
𝑖 𝑗 ≤ 𝑑𝑚. The MIS objective maximizes the number of selected
areas:
Maximize
𝑛∑︁
𝑖=1
𝑥𝑖
By keep finding MIS qualified for a minimum distance, we can find
a more precise range of 𝑑𝑚 by iteration.
Constraints: To ensure we select exact𝑝 seeds from dataset and
try to make them scattered, we enforce the following constraints:
MIS Constraint. No two adjacent areas in𝐺 ′ can both be selected
as seeds. For each edge (𝑖, 𝑗 ) ∈ 𝐸′:
𝑥𝑖 ·𝑥 𝑗 = 0
This is enforced by adding a quadratic penalty term 𝜆MIS ·𝑥𝑖 ·𝑥 𝑗 to
the objective, where 𝜆MIS is a sufficiently large penalty coefficient.
The overall objective function with constraints penalties is:
𝑋 = −
∑︁
𝑖 ∈𝑉
𝑥𝑖 + 𝜆MIS
∑︁
(𝑖,𝑗 ) ∈𝐸′
𝑥𝑖𝑥 𝑗
The requirement of selecting exactly 𝑝 seeds is handled by a
classical binary search that repeatedly calls this BQM. After the
BQM returns a maximum independent set of size 𝑘, if 𝑘 ≥ 𝑝, the
distance 𝑑𝑚 is feasible; we increase it to seek better dispersion. If
𝑘 < 𝑝, the distance𝑑𝑚 is too high; we must decrease it. This process
converges on the maximum 𝑑𝑚 that supports a solution of at least
𝑝 seeds. If it converges to more than 𝑝, the final output 𝑝 seeds are
selected at random.
B CQM in Location Optimization
To run the local optimization phase on a D-Wave system, we de-
signed a Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM). This model is defined
by three key components: binary variables representing all areas’
potential moves calculated by CPU [17], an objective function to
estimate the change in heterogeneity, and constraints to preserve
spatial contiguity.
Variables. Let 𝑆 be the set of all possible moves, where a move
is a triplet (𝑖, 𝑑, 𝑟) representing the transfer of area 𝑎𝑖 from a donor
region 𝑅𝑑 to a receiver region 𝑅𝑟 . We define a binary variable for
each possible move:
𝑥𝑖,𝑑,𝑟 =
(
1 if area 𝑎𝑖 is moved from 𝑅𝑑 to 𝑅𝑟
0 otherwise
Based on the separator theorem [16], the number of potential
movable border areas ranges from 2√𝑛𝑝 to 2𝑝√𝑛 in every single
iteration. This is a major number for large values of 𝑛, which is
typically associated with larger 𝑝 values as well.
Objective Function. The objective is to minimize the total esti-
mated change in heterogeneity across all selected moves. This is
formulated as:
Minimize
∑︁
(𝑖,𝑑,𝑟 ) ∈𝑆

Δ ˆ𝐻add + Δ ˆ𝐻remove

·𝑥𝑖,𝑑,𝑟
The terms Δ ˆ𝐻add and Δ ˆ𝐻remove are calculated for each potential
move based on the statistical properties of the involved regions, as
defined in Section 4.2.
Constraints. To ensure the solution is connectivity-stable dur-
ing areas exchanging, we impose the following constraints:
1. One Move per Area. Each movable area 𝑎𝑖 can be transferred at
most once. This is enforced for every area 𝑎𝑖 in the set of movable
areas. Given that for a specific area 𝑎𝑖, its donor region 𝑅𝑑 is fixed,
we sum over all possible receiver regions 𝑅𝑟 :
∀𝑎𝑖 ∈ MovableAreas,
∑︁
𝑟 | (𝑖,𝑑,𝑟 ) ∈𝑆
𝑥𝑖,𝑑,𝑟 ≤ 1
2. Region Stability. Each region 𝑅𝑘 can either act as a donor
for one move or as a receiver for one move, but not both. This is
enforced for every region 𝑘 from 1 to 𝑝:
∀𝑘 ∈ { 1, . . . , 𝑝},
∑︁
(𝑖,𝑘,𝑟 ) ∈𝑆
𝑥𝑖,𝑘,𝑟 +
∑︁
(𝑖,𝑑,𝑘 ) ∈𝑆
𝑥𝑖,𝑑,𝑘 ≤ 1
This constraint ensures that all selected moves are mutually com-
patible within a single iteration, preventing cascading changes that
could invalidate the premises of other concurrent moves.
