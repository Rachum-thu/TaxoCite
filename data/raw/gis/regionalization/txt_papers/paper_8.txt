Abstract
The delineation of school attendance zones (SAZs) is a critical aspect of educational policy,
inﬂuencing student distribution, resource allocation, and educational equity. SAZs determine which
students attend speci ﬁc schools based on geographic boundaries, shaping the demographic
composition of schools and the opportunities available to students. Designing SAZs is a complex
and challenging task, as it requires balancing multiple, often con ﬂicting objectives and constraints.
These include minimizing student travel time, promoting diversity and reducing segregation,
balancing school capacities to prevent overcrowding or underutilization, and maintaining zone
contiguity. In this paper, we present a multi-objective spatial optimization model to address these
competing priorities. We applied this method to redraw the attendance boundaries of elementary
schools in the Riverside Uniﬁed School District, California. The results demonstrate that our model
can signi ﬁcantly reduce school segregation while minimizing student travel time and maintaining
contiguous attendance zones. By generating a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, this approach equips
policymakers with the tools to make informed decisions on SAZ delineation that improve both
equity and logistical ef ﬁciency.

and local levels. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), signed into law in 2015, provides
protections for disadvantaged and high-need students and mandates high academic standards for all.
Additionally, the Biden administration ’s Equity Action Plan furthers this mission by addressing
disparities and supporting underserved communities. While the federal government establishes
broad guidelines and provides funding, the responsibility for districting and resource allocation
ultimately lies with states and local school districts.
State-level policies that have attained a certain level of agreement prioritize some important
aspects including fair distribution of resources, expanding school choice options, ensuring school
safety, and promoting community engagement, among others. Hanson (2024) shows that some
states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey are notable for their substantial per-pupil
spending on public schools, ensuring quality education for all children regardless of income,
disability, or prior academic performance. On the other hand, states like Alabama, Mississippi, and
Nevada struggle to provide the same level of opportunity due to lower per-pupil spending and heavy
reliance on local property taxes. This funding structure often results in under-resourced schools in
lower-income areas, while wealthier districts bene ﬁt from better-funded educational facilities.
The impact of these disparities is evident in public school assignment practices across the United
States. Many school districts utilize assignment policies largely determined by residential addresses,
which results in higher-income families having access to better-resourced schools while lower-
income families are relegated to underfunded districts due to signiﬁcant differences in local property
taxes and housing costs ( Clapp et al., 2008 ; Jud and Watts 1981 ; Kane et al., 2006 ). Efforts to
address these disparities include the implementation of school choice programs, such as charter
schools, magnet schools, and open enrollment policies, which allow families more ﬂexibility in
selecting schools outside of their designated districts ( Rivkin and Welch 2006 ). Even with in-
creasing ﬂexibility in school choice, more than 70% of children still attend the assigned public
school based on school attendance zone (SAZ) boundaries delineated by school districts ( De Brey
et al., 2021 ). To further promote equity and inclusivity, the U.S. Supreme Court strongly en-
couraged, and many states have undertaken reforms to adjust boundaries of SAZs to account for
ethnic and social diversity ( Carlson et al., 2020; Saporito and V an Riper 2016). Particularly, several
school districts have adopted student assignment policies requiring a set proportion of minority
students, while others mandate a speci ﬁc percentage of socioeconomically disadvantaged students
(Carlson et al., 2020 ; Reardon and Rhodes 2011 ).
Although efforts have been made to reduce segregation in schools, these actions may inad-
vertently create new challenges. Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District
No. 1 (2007) is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that addressed the use of race in public school
student assignment plans. More speci ﬁcally, the Seattle School District used a racial factor as a
tiebreaker to decide which students would be admitted to oversubscribed high schools. If the
demographics of a school signi ﬁcantly deviated from those of the district, the racial tiebreaker
would give preference to underrepresented groups. Parents for Engaged Community Schools, a
nonproﬁt organization, launched a lawsuit contesting the constitutionality of this racial tiebreaker
plan and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in their favor with a 5-4 decision. The notable case
underscored the limitations of using race as a criterion in public school assignments, emphasizing
that any race-based action must be thoroughly scrutinized and justi ﬁed. Even when taking race into
account, it should be treated as one of several aspects and may not be the decisive factor.
In addition to these widely recognized priorities, at the local level, there has often been an
implicit or explicit preference for creating contiguous school attendance zones. This preference is
frequently tied to the goals of maintaining neighborhood cohesion and simplifying transportation
routes (FCPS 2024; Sistrunk et al., 2023), although the empirical evidence supporting these beneﬁts
over other considerations, such as diversity and equity, is varied and has been increasingly
questioned ( Asson et al., 2024 ; Richards, 2014 ; Saporito and V an Riper, 2016 ).

Delineating SAZs is a complicated task due to the need to balance multiple, often con ﬂicting
objectives and constraints. In this paper, we propose a new student assignment approach that can
minimize travel time for students and reduce segregation while balancing school capacities to
prevent overcrowding or underutilization, and maintaining contiguity of zones. The next section
provides a review of various school districting methods, followed by a detailed description of our
proposed model. We then applied this model to the Riverside Uni ﬁed School District in California,
USA to demonstrate how to use this new method to assist with SAZ delineation. We close the paper
with a discussion of our key ﬁndings and suggestions for future research.
Background
A variety of optimization models with diverse objectives and constraints have been used to de-
termine SAZ boundaries in order to facilitate public school student assignment ( Caro et al., 2004 ;
Delmelle et al., 2014; Ferland and Gu´enette 1990; Heckman and Taylor 1969; Lemberg and Church
2000; Schoepﬂe and Church, 1991 ; Wei et al., 2022 ). Minimizing travel distance and/or time has
been a key objective of several initial endeavors since 1960s (e.g., Franklin and Koenigsberg, 1973;
Jennergren and Obel 1980 ; Lemberg and Church 2000 ; Maxﬁeld 1972 ; Schoepﬂe and Church
1991). Reducing travel cost could lower transportation expenses for school districts, encourage
students’ active school travel, decrease the potential dangers of long commutes, and facilitate
regular school attendance, particularly for students from low-income families who may lack reliable
transportation ( Andersson et al., 2012 ; Li and Zhao 2015 ; Liu et al., 2024 ). Consequently, initial
research formulated the process of de ﬁning SAZ as a classic transportation or network ﬂow
problem, considering the assignment of students to schools as a commodity that ﬂows from
neighborhoods to schools ( Belford and Ratliff 1972 ; Jennergren and Obel 1980 ; Maxﬁeld 1972 ;
Schoepﬂe and Church 1991 ). Nevertheless, the network ﬂow approach does not effectively capture
many distinctive requirements of school district planning, such as the geographical contiguity of
SAZs, the variable capacity of schools, the necessity for racial balance, and many diverse, often
conﬂicting objectives ( Lemberg and Church 2000 ).
Geographical contiguity also plays an important role in school redistricting since contiguous
districts are strongly preferred in many school districts based on assumptions that contiguity
promotes community integrity and facilitate easier access to schools ( Sistrunk et al., 2023 ). For
example, the Fairfax County adjusted school boundaries to eliminate attendance islands, a geo-
graphic area that is assigned to a school although the area is not contiguous to the attendance area
(FCPS 2024 ). Many studies have used geographic contiguity as a constraint, either implicitly or
explicitly, in their optimization models for deﬁning SAZs (Franklin and Koenigsberg 1973; Shirabe
2009). Nevertheless, in contrast to the legal requirements many U.S. states impose on Congressional
redistricting—such as mandating geographic contiguity —no such legal standard exists for the
contiguity of school attendance boundaries. Recent research has highlighted that forcing contiguity
can directly con ﬂict with other important objectives, such as achieving racial or socioeconomic
balance, especially in residentially segregated areas. For instance,
Saporito (2017) demonstrated
that school attendance zones with irregular shapes —including those comprising multiple non-
contiguous areas—tend to exhibit lower levels of income segregation. Similarly, recent research by
Asson et al. (2024) ﬁnds that non-contiguous zoning is more often linked to greater racial diversity
within schools, as it enables the deliberate inclusion of demographically distinct neighborhoods.
As i g n iﬁcant body of literature has dedicated to examining aggregated patterns and trends among
racially diverse public school districts ( Logan et al., 2008 ; Reardon et al., 2000 ; Richards 2014).
V arious segregation indices, such as the dissimilarity index ( Logan et al., 2008 ; Logan and Oakley
2004), Gini index (Rivkin 1994), and entropy index (Reardon et al., 2000), have been used to measure
or assess racial/ethnical segregation in public schools. Several optimization models incorporate
Wei et al. 3
diversity requirements into the formulation of school districting problem; however, most just establish
thresholds for targeted minority populations at schools rather than explicitly integrating segregation
indices into objective functions or constraints (Church and Murray 1993; Lemberg and Church, 2000;
Liggett 1973; Wilson 1985). For example, the classic formulation of the Generic School Districting
Problem (GdiP) and its extensions specify the minimum/maximum minority enrollment counts or
percentages at each school (Lemberg and Church 2000; Schoepﬂe and Church 1991). Wei et al. (2022)
conducted one of the few studies that explicitly use the minimization of segregation indices as
districting objectives. They calculated racial segregation using the dissimilarity index among schools
in a district and set minimizing the dissimilarity index as the single objective for student assignment.
However, their model often led to substantial increases in student travel time and resulted in many
non-contiguous SAZs. Even with geographic proximity constraints, their single objective to minimize
racial segregation somewhat negatively impacted another important goal of school districting: en-
suring accessible educational opportunities for all students.
This leads to a signi ﬁcant research gap. While many school districting models has the objective
of minimizing transportation cost and a few has the goal of minimizing segregation, there is a lack of
method that integrates both important goals. Although some models enforce contiguity and others
ignore it, few provide a mechanism to control the degree of non-contiguity. A model that simply
minimizes segregation may produce highly fragmented zones that are logistically or politically
infeasible. Therefore, a more comprehensive method is needed —one that can minimize segregation
and travel costs while allowing for non-contiguity in a controlled manner.
Method
In this paper, we ﬁrst present a multi-objective spatial optimization model aimed at designing SAZs
that can minimize student travel distances and reduce racial segregation within a school district.
Consider the following notation.
Parameters
i, j = index of census units (I entire set)
k = index of schools (K entire set)
S
i = number of students in census unit i
Ni = number of minority students in census unit i
Wi = number of majority students in census unit i
Ai = adjacent neighbors of census unit i
Ck = capacity of school k
Dik = transport cost from census unit i to school k
FChigh
k = fractional upper bound on capacity usage of school k
FClow
k = fractional lower bound on capacity usage of school k

The number of students in census unit i is denoted as Si, while the number of minority students is
represented by Ni and the number of majority students is represented by Wi. Each school has a
predetermined capacity, Ck . The transportation cost between census unit i and school k, typically
measured in travel distance or travel time, is precomputed and denoted as Dik . The capacity usage of
each school is constrained by a fractional lower bound FClow
k and upper bound FChigh
k . A maximum
transport cost is prespeciﬁed for each school to ensure that no student needs to travel too far to go to
school.
Binary decision variables xik are used to ensure that all students from a single census unit are
assigned to the same school, as splitting neighborhoods is generally undesirable due to potential
negative social and political impacts ( Caro et al., 2004 ; Lemberg and Church 2000 ). With this
notation the multi-objective school districting model is formulated as follows:

The objective (1) is to minimize the total travel costs of the students of each census unit to their
assigned schools. The objective (2) is to minimize the racial segregation among schools in the
school district that is measured using the dissimilarity index. The dissimilarity index is one of the
most widely used segregation measure to assess school district racial/ethnic segregation ( Farley
1984; Logan et al., 2008; Logan and Oakley 2004; Wei et al., 2022; Wilson 1985). The dissimilarity
index represents the percentage of the students that would have to change their schools for the two
social groups to be evenly distributed across the entire school district. Constraint (3) ensures that
each census unit is assigned to exactly one school. Constraints (4) and (5) stipulate that no school
violates capacity usage lower bound and upper bound. Constraints (6) specify the maximum travel
cost allowed for a school assignment. Constraints (7) impose binary conditions on decision
variables.
While this model integrates both travel cost and segregation minimization into the objectives, the
optimal solutions of this model may contain highly fragmented zones that are logistically or
politically infeasible. As mentioned previously, there are some previous models that impose strict
constraints that require each SAZ zone is a single, unbroken, and continuous geographic area
(Shirabe 2009 ). However, unlike congressional districting, contiguity is a desirable but not
mandated feature when delineating SAZs. In fact many SAZs are not one single contiguous zone,
Wei et al. 5
and multiple disconnected zones could be assigned to one school in various school districts
(Saporito 2017 ). In addition, it may require the compromise of other important goals, such as
segregation reduction ( Asson et al., 2024 ; Saporito 2017). To address this issue, we introduce a set
of constraints that allows us to control the degree of non-contiguity of SAZ zones. Consider the
following additional notation.
Q = number of contiguous zones
M = large number
v
ik ¼
/C26
1, if unit i is selected as a sink in the SAZ of school k
0, otherwise
yijk ¼ accumulated flow from uniti to j destined for sinks in SAZ of school k
Q is the number of contiguous zones to be identi ﬁed. It is important to note that Q may not be the
same as the number of schools. In other words, multiple contiguous zones might belong to the same
school to allow some degree of non-contiguity. Additional decision variables, including vik and yijk ,
are introduced to control the non-contiguity of SAZs.

Constraints ( 8)–(11) are necessary for ensuring the contiguity of Q identiﬁed zones. These
contiguity constraints are an extension of the network ﬂow contiguity constraints in Shirabe (2005)
and Murray et al. (2022) to allow for Q contiguous zones identi ﬁed and each zone assigned to a
school. Speciﬁcally, we consider the set of census units as a network where each unit is a node and a
bidirectional arc exists between any two adjacent census units. A zone is de ﬁned as a sub-network
where one node acts as a sink, and all other nodes supply one unit. For the zone to be considered
contiguous, the supply from each source node must reach the sink without traversing nodes outside
the sub-network. Constrains (8) ensures that for all units assigned to school k, the net out ﬂow for
non-sink units is larger than 1 and the net in ﬂow for sink units can be as large as M /C0 1. Constraints
(9) limit ﬂow out of a unit unless it is included in a SAZ zone, where the most ﬂow out could be
M /C0 1. Shirabe (2005) and Murray et al. (2022) require that each zone only has exactly one sink to
guarantee that jKj contiguous zones are identi ﬁed. However, as mentioned previously, contiguity is
a desirable but not mandatory feature for SAZs and many SAZs are not one single contiguous zone.
To encourage contiguity, we use constraints (10) to prespecify the total number of contiguous zones
(sinks) identiﬁed. When Q ¼j Kj, jKj contiguous zones will be identi ﬁed and each zone is assigned
to one school. When Q > jKj, multiple contiguous zones could be assigned to one school. Con-
straints (11) link unit assignment and sink designation, requiring a unit to be assigned to schoolk if it
6 EPB: Urban Analytics and City Science 0(0)
is also to serve as the sink for the zone. Constraints (12) impose binary and non-negativity
conditions on decision variables.
Figure 1 shows an example where there are 9 census units (units a to i) that need to be assigned to
two schools (schools #1 and #2). If Q is set as two, two contiguous zones will be identiﬁed with each
assigned to one school as denoted by blue and yellow color in Figure 1(a) . The corresponding
network representation is shown in Figure 1(b) where one unit of ﬂow is coming out of each node
and reaching a sink node. Since Q ¼ 2, constraint (10) P
k
P
i vik ¼ 2 ensures that two sinks are
designated, vd1 ¼ vh2 ¼ 1, one for school #1 and the other for school #2. Then constraints (9) ensure
that a ﬂow exists between two units only if both units are assigned to one school. Constraints (8)
specify that the net out ﬂows for units a, b and c are equal to one but for the sink unit d can be all the
source ﬂows into it. If Q is set as three, three sinks are designated, vd1 ¼ vf 1 ¼ vh2 ¼ 1, two for
school #1 and one for school #2. Three contiguous zones will be identi ﬁed as shown in Figure 1(c).
This is how we can use constraints (8)-(12) to control the degree of non-contiguity. They can

Wei et al. 7
encourage contiguity without requiring each SAZ to be a single contiguous zone by setting Q to a
value larger than the number of schools.
There are several nuances in this new multi-objective model compared with previous school
districting models. First, these two objectives allow us to identify SAZs that can minimize student
travel cost while achieving the minimal school segregation. This has not been considered in
previous models. Second, the parameter Q combined with constraints (8)-(12) can control how
many contiguous zones can be formed. Third, the proposed model establishes a capacity range
requirement for each school using FC
high
k and FClow
k , instead of a simple capacity constraint in many
previous models. This approach allows for considering the potential expansion of existing schools
and achieving a balanced utilization among all schools. For example, if FChigh
k and FClow
k are both
set at 30%, each school could accommodate between 70% and 190% of its current capacity.
This model has two objectives, meaning that there is no one de ﬁnitive solution, but rather
tradeoff solutions re ﬂecting competing preferences between the transport cost and segregation of
each school district. We will use the constraint method ( Cohon, 2013 ), where one objective is
integrated into the model as a constraint and the second objective optimized. Speci ﬁcally, we will
convert objective (2) into an additional constraint in the model:

where B is a feasible segregation index value. It is important to note that the absolute value can be
easily linearized as done in Wei et al. (2022) . By varying B across a set of potential segregation
goals, different single-objective models result and can be solved using exact mixed integer pro-
gramming (MIP) approaches. Among these tradeoff solutions we will identify the nondominated or
pareto-optimal solutions where no transport cost can be reduced without increasing the segregation
value. Each pareto-optimal solution represents a potential SAZ delineation with the minimal
transport cost given a segregation threshold.
Results
We utilized the proposed model to assess racial segregation in the Riverside Uni ﬁed School District
(RUSD) in California, USA. The analysis was based on public school data from the 2015-
2016 academic year, sourced from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This data
includes school locations, SAZs, and student enrollment numbers for each grade. Additionally, we
obtained data on the number of 1
st grade students by race at each census block group from the 2014-
2018 American Community Survey (ACS) school enrollment data. There are seven racial/ethnic
groups: Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Asian, non-
Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Hawaiian Native/Paci ﬁc Islander, and non-
Hispanic Two or More Races. Here, non-Hispanic White was considered the majority group, while
the others were considered minority groups.
There are 30 elementary schools offering 1
st grade in RUSD but only 29 of them have delineated
SAZs as shown in Figure 2 . The 2014-2018 ACS shows that there are 153 block groups within
RUSD. These block groups have 3,299 1 st grade students, with 623 non-Hispanic White students
and 2,676 students of minorities. While many SAZs are contiguous, 10 out of 30 schools are
fragmented, such as Victoria Elementary and Jefferson Elementary. You can also ﬁnd that the
current SAZs might split some block groups because the RUSD may not de ﬁne the SAZs based on
census block group boundaries ( Figure 2). However, the census block group is the smallest unit for
which the Census reports school enrollment by race. We therefore overlaid the block group
8 EPB: Urban Analytics and City Science 0(0)
centroids with the NCES SAZs to determine the current student assignment. We applied the index of
dissimilarity using the current student assignment to evaluate the current racial segregation in
RUSD. The analysis revealed a dissimilarity index of 0.39 for RUSD, suggesting that 39% of
students from either racial group would need to transfer to a different school to achieve an even
distribution. According to Logan et al. (2008) , a dissimilarity score of 0.39 indicates moderate
segregation.

We then applied the proposed multi-objective model to determine if it is possible to identify a
SAZ delineation that can improve access and reduce segregation while maintaining the contiguity of
most SAZs. Since the NCES did not provide school capacity data, we used the total number of
enrolled students as a proxy for each school ’s capacity ( C
k ). To simplify, we set both the fractional
lower and upper bounds on capacity usage (FClow
k and FChigh
k ) to 0.3 across all schools. This ensures
that the maximum number of students assigned to each school is 1.3 times the current enrollment,
and the minimum is 0.7 times the current enrollment. We also compared the current student as-
signment with school capacity, showing that eight of 29 schools are beyond 130% of the capacity
and seven of 29 schools do not reach the 70% of the capacity. We pre-calculated the travel time
between block group centroids and schools using ESRI StreetMap Premium, setting the maximum
transport cost ( T
k ) to 30 minutes. Since the current SAZs has 10 incontiguous zones, we set the
minimum number of contiguous zones ( Q) identiﬁed to be 40, which allow at most 10 schools have
incontiguous zones. As mentioned earlier, we used the constraint method to identify the pareto-
optimal solutions by varying the maximum segregation value from 10% to 40% with a step increase
of 1% to ensure that these tradeoff solutions can lead to reduced segregation given the current
dissimilarity index of 39.26%.
The two models were implemented in Python and solved using the commercial integer pro-
gramming solver, Gurobi. The computations were performed on a computer with an Intel Core
i9 CPU (2.30 GHz), 32 GB of RAM, running on a Windows operating system. We set a solution
time limit of 1 hour when solving these models using Gurobi. The pareto-optimal solutions for
model without contiguity constraints were reported in Table 1.
The column “Number of contiguous zones ” is the number of contiguous zones identi ﬁed in
the solution. The column “Dissimilarity index ” is the segregation, objec tive (2), indicating the
percentage of students from either racial group who would need to transfer to a different school
to achieve an even distribution. Column “Total travel time ” is the student total travel time,
objective (1). The column “Total travel time for minority students ” is the total travel time of
minority students whereas the column “Total travel time for majority students ” is the total
travel time of majority students. When varyi ng the maximum segregation from 10% to 35%
with a step increase of 1%, some models did not ﬁnd a feasible solution within 1 hour.
However, these tradeoff solutions reported in Tables 1 and 2 are all optimal solutions with an
optimality gap of 0.00%. When no contigu ity constraints are imposed, we identi ﬁed 27 pareto-
optimal solutions. The minimal total travel time found is 14,393.94 min with an average travel
time of 4.36 min per student, and the school distr ict segregation is simila r to the current student
assignment with a dissimilarity index of 39.39%. The minimal segregation found is 12.97%
which is a 67% reduction from the current segregation level, but the travel cost increases to
16,558.61 min with an average travel time of 5.02 min per student. The minimum total travel
time for minority students is found when D ¼ 31:99%, and the minimum total travel time for
majority students I found when D ¼ 37:37%. It is also important to note that the identi ﬁed
SAZs without contiguity constraints are quite fragmented given Q varies from 57 to 70 al-
though only 30 schools exist.
The pareto-optimal solutions for model with contiguity constraints were reported in Table 2.
After integrating contiguity constraints, we cannot identify any feasible solutions when D ≤ 0:24:
The model also becomes more computationally challenging to solve as the solution time increases
quite signiﬁcantly. With contiguity constraints imposed, we identi ﬁed 13 pareto-optimal solutions.
The minimal total travel time found is also 14,393.94 min with an average trave time of 4.36 min per
student, and the school district segregation is similar to the current student assignment with a
dissimilarity index of 39.39%. The minimal segregation found is 24.93% which is a 36% reduction
from the current segregation level, but the travel cost increases to 14,600.17 min with an average
10 EPB: Urban Analytics and City Science 0(0)
trave time of 4.43 min per student. The minimum total travel time for minority students is found
when D ¼ 30:23%, and the minimum total travel time for majority students I found when
D ¼ 37:37%. All these solutions have identi ﬁed 39 or 40 contiguous zones, which is similar to the
current SAZs.
The pareto-optimal curves for model without and with contiguity constraints are displayed in
Figure 3. There is clearly a tradeoff between minimizing total travel time and school segregation.
Reducing segregation means that the student travel time would increase, or rather more students
would need to travel to further schools. It is also interesting to note that the pareto-optimal solutions
for model without and with contiguity constraints have the same objective values when D >0 :24,
even though the solutions have completely different number of contiguous zones identi ﬁed.
Figures 4 and 5 show the delineation of SAZs without and with contiguity constraints at D ≤ 25%
and D ≤ 35%, respectively. When the segregation goal is set as D ≤ 25%, both models (without and
with contiguity constraints) yield the same optimal objective values, a total travel time of
14600.17 and a dissimilarity index of 24.93%, which is a 36.50% decrease from the current 39.26%.
This is also the minimal segregation that can be reached at RUSD while satisfying contiguity
constraints. While the objective values stay the same with and without contiguity constraints, the

contiguous zones vary quite signi ﬁcantly. Without contiguity constraints only 12 schools have a
single contiguous SAZ zone assigned, whereas the other schools have 2 to 6 contiguous zones
assigned (Figure 4(a)). After imposing contiguity constraints 22 schools a single contiguous SAZ
zone assigned, seven schools have two contiguous block group zones assigned and one school

When segregation goal is set as D ≤ 35%, the segregation increases 40% but the total travel time
only decreases 1% to 14,435.37 min compared with the scenario of D ≤ 25%.The objective values
stay the same with and without contiguity constraints. Without contiguity constraints only
13 schools have a single contiguous SAZ zone assigned, whereas the other schools have 2 to
6 contiguous zones assigned (Figure 5(a)). After imposing contiguity constraints 22 schools a single
contiguous SAZ zone assigned, seven schools have two contiguous block group zones assigned and
one school (Hawthorne Elementary School) has three contiguous zones assigned.
Discussion and conclusion
This study presents a multi-objective spatial optimization model for designing SAZs that addresses the
key challenges of minimizing student travel time, reducing racial segregation, and managing geo-
graphical zone structure. The application of the model to the RUSD demonstrates its effectiveness in
generating a range of policy options and offers valuable insights into school district planning.
The results reveal a clear tradeoff between travel time and segregation reduction. A key insight
for planners is that this tradeoff is not linear. As shown in the Pareto curve, initial reductions in
segregation can be achieved with modest increases in travel time, but achieving the lowest levels of
segregation comes at a much higher marginal cost. This quantitative tradeoff map allows poli-
cymakers to make data-driven decisions about how to balance equity goals with logistical and
ﬁnancial constraints.
The model’s ability to control the level of zone fragmentation is another signiﬁcant contribution. The
RUSD results show that substantial desegregation canbe achieved while only requiring a small number
of non-contiguous SAZ zones. This demonstrates that it is not an all-or-nothing choice between perfect
contiguity and extreme fragmentation. A valuable insight is that the model itself, through its travel time
minimization objective, tends to ﬁnd the most geographically compact solutions possible for a given
segregation level. This means planners can allow for non-contiguity to break patterns of residential
segregation but can trust the model to do so in a way that is as ef ﬁcient as possible.
While the model provides technically optimal solutions, its implementation faces signi ﬁcant
social and political challenges. The very goal of “reducing segregation ” is complex. Policies that
disperse minority students from their home communities to achieve a district-wide demographic
balance can have social costs (Mawene and Bal. 2020). This is analogous to debates over “majority-
minority” political districts, where concentrating a minority group can empower them to elect a
candidate of their choice, whereas dispersal may lead to greater in ﬂuence in more districts but less
direct representation. Similarly, creating integrated schools may mean that minority students are
always in the minority, which could impact their sense of belonging or educational experience
(Burdick–Will, 2018). Our analysis showing that minority students may bear a slightly larger travel
burden highlights the need to examine the distribution of costs and bene ﬁts of any plan.
Furthermore, the public acceptability of non-contiguous zones is a practical hurdle. While this
research and other studies show their effectiveness in promoting integration, communities may
resist such plans, which can seem unintuitive or unfair to residents who are “skipped over ” to be
included in a distant school ’s SAZ.
Therefore, the model should not be seen as a ﬁnal arbiter, but as a decision-support tool. The
Pareto-optimal solutions it generates should serve as the starting point for a public engagement
process. The question of “who decides which solution is optimal? ” must be answered by the
community itself. School districts can use the maps and tradeoff data generated by the model to
facilitate an informed discussion with parents, teachers, and other stakeholders, allowing them to
collectively choose a plan that aligns with their shared values and priorities.
This study has several limitations that open avenues for future research. First, we used the
dissimilarity index for two groups. Future work should employ multigroup segregation measures,
14 EPB: Urban Analytics and City Science 0(0)
such as the entropy index, to better capture the nuances of diversity in a multiracial context. Second,
reﬁning the optimization algorithms to reduce computation times would facilitate the use of the
model in larger or more complex districts. Moreover, while our model controls the number of non-
contiguous polygons, future models could incorporate objectives to explicitly minimize frag-
mentation or maximize compactness, providing even greater control over the zones ’ geographical
character. Finally, exploring the integration of stakeholder preferences in the optimization process
could help ensure that the resulting SAZ designs align with community values and priorities.
In conclusion, the proposed spatial optimization model represents a valuable contribution to the
ﬁeld of equitable school district planning. By quantifying the tradeoffs between travel costs and
racial integration and by offering a way to manage zone contiguity, it provides a practical tool to help
policymakers and communities navigate the complex challenge of designing SAZs that promote
educational equity.
