Abstract
In this paper, we propose a spatially constrained clustering problem belonging to the
family of 𝑝-regions problems. Our formulation is motivated by the recent developments of
economic complexity on the evolution of the economic output through key interactions among
industries within economic regions. The objective of this model consists in aggregating a
set of geographic areas into a prescribed number of regions (so-called innovation ecosystems)
such that the resulting regions preserve the most relevant interactions among industries. We
formulate the 𝑝-Innovation Ecosystems model as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem
and propose a heuristic solution approach. We explore a case involving the municipalities
of Colombia to illustrate how such a model can be applied and used for policy and regional
development.

The 𝒑-Innovation Ecosystems problem.
1 Introduction
Since the seminal papers of Robert Solow, the mainstream analyses of economic growth have had
aggregate growth models (Solow, 1957; Solow, 1956) as its principal workhorse. Abstract quantities
such as technological progress or positive externalities, like spillovers or scale eﬀects, usually play
a central role in classical growth theory since they are, at last, the primary mechanisms that
encourage ﬁrms productivity and, therefore, generate economic growth. Nevertheless, given that
the aggregative models address the interaction between diﬀerent goods as a black box, they cannot
endogenize the positive externalities that come from the strategic production of complementary
goods; like the scale eﬀects or the spillover eﬀects mentioned above ( Hidalgo et al., 2007).
Regardless of the approach (aggregative or not), the general consensus is that the diversiﬁcation
of the productive structure (i.e., selective innovation) stands out as a fundamental goal to foster
economic growth. Thus, many theoretical eﬀorts have been directed to understand and identify
suitable environments for innovation such as cities or industrial clusters (see e.g. Krugman, 1991).
Classic examples of such ideas within the context of urban economics are the so-called Jacobs’
externalities (Jacobs, 2016) and the agglomeration and location externalities of the New Economic
Geography (NEG). The approaches of Jacobs and the NEG intended to provide a more detailed study
of the positive eﬀects of industrial interaction, advocating for the diversiﬁcation of the production
and the division of labor as concomitant processes that boost innovation opportunities.
Understanding the relatedness structure among economic activities thus becomes a key part of
the analysis of diversiﬁcation and agglomeration of ﬁrms. Several studies following the pioneering
ideas introduced by Hausmann and Hidalgo have found in network theory a suitable framework to
understand the impacts of the productive structure of countries and regions on their diversiﬁcation
patterns ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007; Neﬀke et al. , 2011; Hausmann and Hidalgo , 2011; Hausmann
et al. , 2014). Hidalgo et al. (2007) introduced the Product Space (PS), an undirected network
capturing the relatedness structure of the tradable goods of the world market. This network
revealed a core-periphery distribution, where the more complex goods ,i.e., the ones requiring more
know-how, are highly connected whereas goods requiring fewer know-how and skills are more
likely to be leaves of the graph. Complex goods are present in countries with a diverse export
basket and according to Hidalgo et al. (2007) and Hausmann and Hidalgo (2011) arise naturally by
the interaction of existing industries. Therefore, enhancing the production of complex goods and
fostering industrial interactions that lead to their emergence are natural policy goals to pursue. In
fact, Hausmann et al. (2014) shows that the amount of complexity reached by a country is a strong
predictor of its economic growth.
However, geographic, institutional and historical factors such as distance among ﬁrms, topography,
administrative borders, diﬀerential taxes among states, productivity, labor availability and so forth
are important constraints that may preclude the formation of optimal industrial clusters, i.e., the
2
idiosyncratic factors of the territory can encourage the agglomeration of industries producing
peripheral, or less valuable, industries in terms of the PS. This clustering process, although
suboptimal, ends up reinforcing itself by the impact of the agglomeration economies that, despite
all the possible drawbacks like congestion or elevated factor costs, leads the ﬁrms to locate close to
each other (Diodato et al., 2018 and Rosenthal and Strange, 2004). On top of that, empirical studies
have shown that the predictions of NEG (Martin and Sunley, 1996) are not robust and that the eﬀects
of Jacobs externalities are (at most) inconclusive ( De Groot et al. , 2016). It can be argued that the
lack of conclusive empirical validation of the aforementioned theories is partially explained by the
trade-oﬀ between diversity and similarity (see Neﬀke et al., 2011): labor, knowledge, and know-how
diﬀuse easily among similar ﬁrms, but only the interaction between ﬁrms distinct enough can induce
the generation of new ideas. More precisely, this idea (taken from cognitive theory) explain how a
non-directed diversiﬁcation can either lead to big dissimilarities among ﬁrms (cognitive distance)
hampering interaction or lead to an excessive overlapping of skills amounting to cognitive lock-in
(Neﬀke et al. , 2011). In the case of regions, this trade-oﬀ can be put in terms of capacity of a
region to incorporate technologies or knowledge from other region (absorptive capacity) ( Jung and
López-Bazo, 2017). This concept has turned out to be useful to explain disparities in productivity
levels among economic regions and, analogously, to explain the cognitive lock-in among ﬁrms. It
has been noticed that some kinds of poverty traps are generated when regions with low absorptive
capacity cluster together. This obeys the fact that the beneﬁts of the investments directed to
accumulate knowledge within the region are not maximized due to the lack of absorptive capacity
of the surrounding regions (see e.g. Caragliu and Nijkamp, 2016).
Summing up, we face a setting in which (1) there are (quantiﬁable) target interactions among
ﬁrms that enhance the innovation processes, (2) these key interactions could be hindered or neglected
by incompatible local industrial policies inherent to the regional divisions, (3) these regional
divisions are structural and, in most of the cases, unmodiﬁable, and (4) it is not sustainable or
impossible to relocate ﬁrms from one region to another. With this scenario in mind, in this
article we propose a quantitative model, the 𝑝-Innovation Ecosystems ( 𝑝-IE) model, with three
main goals in mind: ﬁrst, to identify the most relevant interactions among existing industries
in the country; second, to identify feasible sets of target goods that can improve the economic
complexity of the country; and third, to ﬁnd optimal regional conﬁgurations (formed by spatially
contiguous administrative units) that maximizes the most relevant interactions among the key
industries (according to the previous two elements of the model) within each region. Thus, the
𝑝-IE model is intended to enable policymakers to apply suitable regional industrial policies that
foster innovation processes according to the productive structure of each region. Roughly speaking,
in terms of the literature of economic complexity, the 𝑝-IE model seeks to design regions that
improve the local cohesiveness of the regional productive structure according to its position in the
PS and, simultaneously, looks for an optimal diﬀusion branching into the most complex neighboring
industries in the PS.
The 𝑝-IE model is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that belongs to
the family of the 𝑝-regions models devised by Duque et al. (2011). In brief, the 𝑝-IE involves
the aggregation of 𝑛 areas into 𝑝 spatially contiguous regions that (1) maximizes the number of
3
links (𝑙, 𝑚) in the PS for which industries 𝑙 and 𝑚 are within the same region; and (2) identiﬁes
strategic relationships between industries within regions that maximizes the probability of activating
innovation processes that allow the region to “jump” to more complex neighboring nodes in the
PS. Since the 𝑝-IE model is related to a family of problems that are classiﬁed as computationally
non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) ( Cliﬀ et al. , 1975; Keane, 1975), we propose a
heuristic solution to eﬀectively compute a near-optimal, if not optimal solution.
From a practical point of view, this approach oﬀers a new way to study the role of regions
within countries (e.g., states in United States, departments in Colombia, autonomous communities
in Spain, etc.) either as boosters or as obstructions for the key industrial interactions that lead to the
improvement of the complexity of the country. More precisely, the existence of regions may aﬀect
the evolution of the productive structure in two ways: on the one hand, regional borders between two
industries may impair their interaction (as nodes in the PS) diminishing the positive externalities
predicted from classical economic theory; on the other hand, the incentives generated by the local
administrations could shape the innovation processes of diﬀerent regions in rather distinct ways
enhancing some industrial interactions and discouraging others.
The rest of the paper is presented as follows: Section 2 contains a literature review with the
main conceptual elements upon which our model is built up. Section 3 contains a step-by-step
construction of the model, the exact formulation, and some illustrative examples. Section 4 presents
the heuristic method to solve large instances of this model. Section 5 presents a case of study for
Colombia. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and possible future research lines.
2 Literature review
The main ideas of this paper are built upon three theoretical bases: (1) complexity theory of
Hausmann and Hidalgo, (2) evolutionary economics, and (3) the family of 𝑝-regions models. This
section is basically devoted to discussing the features of these three theories that are relevant for our
work.
Hausmann and Hidalgo present in Hausmann and Hidalgo (2011) their theory based upon two
main principles: (1) products are the combination of capabilities (of all sorts: inputs, technology,
know-how, institutions), and (2) a country can produce a product if and only if it has all the required
capabilities to produce the product. Since capabilities are not observable they are determined a
posteriori based on two main consequences of their assumptions: (a) the diversity of the products
manufactured by a country is related to the diversity and number of capabilities in the country, so
that, more capabilities lead to more products; (b) the ubiquity of a product (how many countries
produce that product) is a measure of the number of capabilities required by the product.
Although capabilities are quite reminiscent of a general input in the standard production theory in
economics, it is important to point out that Hausmann and Hidalgo use them in a more instrumental
way. That is, the function that turns capabilities into products is binary (a characteristic function),
4
i.e., it only determines whether the product is produced or not given the availability of the required
capabilities within the country (see Hausmann and Hidalgo , 2011). Their approach in Hausmann
and Hidalgo, 2011 is also blind with respect to the intensity of the factors, i.e., it only captures the
requirement of a factor and not the amount or the way in which the factor is required for production.
Hence, their assignation function that relates capabilities with products cannot be thought of as a
production function but as a vector of characteristics of each existent good in the global economy
(more related to the international trade theory of Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek, (see Hausmann et al. ,
2019).
The practical work of Hausmann and Hidalgo is divided into two main blocks, complexity
theory and relatedness theory, both underpinned by the concept of capabilities. The concept of
economic complexity is derived from a recursive analysis on the duality between diversity (number
of exports of a country) and ubiquity (number of countries exporting a product). Diversity per
se is not a good measure of the amount of capabilities a country has, since the types of products
exported among countries may have substantially diﬀerent capability requirements depending on
the productive characteristics of the exporter. The amount of capabilities required by any product
is correlated with the scarcity of the product, i.e., if a product requires a lot of rare capabilities only
few countries would be able to produce it. Thus, the interplay of these two concepts, diversity and
ubiquity, can determine (as a posterior measure) the amount and the type of existing capabilities
within the countries and required by the products. Also, this method helps to determine the degree
of complexity embodied in a product. The exact recursive procedure proposed in Hausmann et al.
(2014) will be further discussed in Section 3.1.
It is important to note that the economic complexity of a country is determined by the complexity
of the products produced by the country. With this in mind, and according to the ﬁndings in
Hausmann et al. (2014), complex products can be regarded as target products that may be reached
(produced) by a country in order to improve its overall complexity and, therefore, its economic
growth. The question of how these complex goods can be reached by speciﬁc countries is addressed
from the relatedness theory that corresponds to the dynamic component of Hausmann and Hidalgo’s
theory. The dynamic component of Hausmann and Hidalgo’s theory appears in Hidalgo et al. (2007)
when they seek to understand how countries diversify over time (which, in their terms, is equivalent
to accumulating capabilities). They do this with using network theory (the PS): where the nodes are
products and the strength of the link is determined by the number of capabilities shared by them,
i.e., the link between two products is high if they require a similar set of capabilities to be produced.
As such, measuring the relatedness between two goods requires using an observable quantity that
captures the capabilities overlapping among goods. However, there is still not a clear consensus on
which is the optimal way to measure the relatedness among a set of products. In fact, the study of
the structure of relatedness of products within countries and geographic units is still an open ﬁeld of
research in economic geography, mostly in evolutionary economic theory (see Neﬀke and Henning,
2013; Boschma, 2017).
For the sake of brevity and since it is the only one to be used in our applications; we consider only
the PS approach proposed in Hidalgo et al. (2007). Similar constructions of networks measuring
5
the structure of the relatedness of geographic areas can be found in Neﬀke et al. (2011), OClery
et al. (2019), and Diodato et al. (2018). All these approaches are designed so that they measure the
co-occurrence (co-production, co-exportation) of goods within the same geographic unit weighted
by some quantity (e.g. input requirements, total output) that reﬂects the extent to which speciﬁc
economic activities are carried out inside each geographic unit. Explicitly, in Hidalgo et al. (2007)
it is proposed a more agnostic or outcome-based approach. Using world trade data, they measure
the relatedness using the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index ( Balassa, 1964, see also
Section 3.1). Based on this index, the PS is deﬁned as the network of available goods in the world
economy with links weighted by the probability of having a comparative advantage among each
pair of goods (see Hidalgo et al. , 2007). Thus, if the weighted links which deﬁne the network are
regarded as probabilities to “jump’ between the nodes that join them, then the PS not only describes
the present output of the country but the actual constraints that face the country to diversify towards
other goods in the network. In fact, if we think the position of a country on the PS as the set of
products in which it has RCA greater or equal to one, then the innovation dynamics of the countries
can be analyzed as diﬀusion processes on the PS ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007; Alshamsi et al. , 2018;
O’Clery et al. , 2018]).
Based on their theoretical framework, moving in the PS requires acquiring missing capabilities
that combined with the existing ones allows a country to produce a new product and, therefore,
move to more complex products in the PS. Thus, the interaction between industries with similar (but
not equal) sets of capabilities plays an important role in the acquisition of new capabilities required
to produce complex products and move towards better positions in the PS.
Together, the complexity embodied in the products and the relatedness structure of the economic
output of the countries provides a tractable framework for longstanding ideas of evolutionary
economic theory. Theories like the process of creative destruction proposed by Schumpeter in
Schumpeter (1939) can be underpinned quantitatively by the path-dependency inherent to the
dynamics on the PS. More explicitly, the evolution led by the natural forces of the economy or the
diﬀusion of the RCA, in terms of the PS, have two main implications: the disappearance of old
industries poorly connected in the PS with the local industry and the appearance of new industries
naturally associated, according to the PS, with the local industry. This issue regarding the selective
evolution of the economic output has been studied empirically in the context of countries ( Hidalgo
et al., 2007; Hausmann and Hidalgo , 2011; Hausmann et al. , 2014), economic regions ( Hausmann
and Neﬀke, 2019; Neﬀke et al., 2011) and cities (OClery et al., 2019; Hausmann et al., 2019) showing
that this phenomenon is transversal to any geographic unit in which industry clustering is admissible.
A remarkable empirical work that sheds light on how the process of creative destruction takes
place in a geographic (regional) framework is presented in Neﬀke et al. (2011). In this work they
study the evolution of the economic output within 70 industrial regions in Sweden along a period of
roughly 30 years (1969-2002). In this work, they measure the evolution of the economic cohesion
of the Swedish regions over time. As a measure of cohesion, they use the average of the closeness
(in the PS) of each product to the existing portfolio in the region. Intuitively a region is cohesive
if there are no incentives for moving, i.e., if the industries within the region are more related
6
among them rather than with industries belonging to other regions. In Neﬀke et al. (2011) they
ﬁnd that the cohesiveness of the regions has a signiﬁcant tendency to increase through the years
following a process or creative destruction. This work provides a solid conﬁrmation of an idea
already hinted by many other studies in complexity theory ( Bustos et al., 2012; OClery et al., 2019;
Diodato et al., 2018): there is a tendency of the geographical clusters (cities, regions, metropolitan
areas) to reproduce the industrial clusters suggested by the PS. In principle, these two types of
clusters (geographic and industrial) may disagree because of historical, geographic, cultural or
political reasons that encouraged certain types of ﬁrms to establish in the region generating an
initial endowment of productive activities that shaped the evolution of the economic landscape of
the region in the subsequent history. Also, for methodological reasons, it is worth recalling that
by construction the PS, at least the one built upon world trade data, captures industrial clusters
independently from spatial features of countries and regions.
Another important implication that can be inferred from the works previously discussed is that
certain policies that seek to boost local economies by restructuring the economic landscape (such
as ﬁrm relocation or selective innovation) may be misleading and may have structural issues due
to the lack of closeness to the existing portfolio of the target region. In terms of the work of
Neﬀke et al. (2011), for example, the introduction of economic activities weakly linked to existing
industries of the region have a higher conditional probability to fail and exit the region. In light of the
contributions of complexity theory and evolutionary economics it seems plausible to take advantage
of the information encoded in the PS to foster a selective improvement of the productivity (or, more
precisely, complexity) as long as the strategy to follow harmonizes with the natural constraints
imposed by the topology of the PS. In this order of ideas, and following the arguments presented in
the introduction, we opted in this paper for a strategy that involves the design of industrial regions
that foster the creation and development of industrial ecosystems. These regions are intended to
be spaces in which the interaction among industries is fostered by suitable public policies so that
the capabilities required to create new and more complex goods appear naturally according to the
dynamics of the PS. This is, the so-called industrial or innovation ecosystems (see also O’Clery
et al., 2018).
There is a wide and broad literature about regional planning and region designing (see e.g.
Fischer, 1980; Duque et al. , 2007); this area has focused in giving objective criteria to deﬁne
suitable regionalizations that help in the implementation of speciﬁc public policies. The main
idea of this approach consists of decomposing global policy objectives that are applied into big
geographic units into local tasks in speciﬁc regions which integrates in a harmonic way and ﬁnally
promotes the achievement of the policy goal ( Fischer, 1980).
Among the formulations for this problem are linear optimization models (Garﬁnkel and Nemhauser,
1970; Zoltners and Sinha , 1983), mixed-integer programming ( Duque et al. , 2011) and nonlinear
models ( Macmillan and Pierce , 1994), and the use of techniques such as implicit enumeration
of feasible solutions ( Garﬁnkel and Nemhauser , 1970) and column generation ( Mehrotra et al. ,
1998). In particular, our model follows the lines of Duque et al. (2011) which is formulated a
mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, called the 𝑝-regions, for aggregating 𝑛 areas into
7
𝑝 spatially contiguous regions, using three diﬀerent strategies to ensure continuity. One of the
main advantages of the 𝑝-regions type models is their ﬂexibility to incorporate spatial contiguity
without adding constraints on the shape of the resulting regions. This, in turn, allows them to
capture a diverse range of spatial patter (compact, elongated, among others). For example, based
on the 𝑝-regions model there have been diﬀerent MIP formulation by adding additional features,
such as maximizing the number of regions being added ( Duque et al. , 2012), generating 𝑝 regions
while maximizing their compactness ( Li et al. , 2014), deﬁning 𝑝-functional regions ( Kim et al. ,
2015), among others. Such formulations ensure that we can obtain an optimal solution. However,
they are computationally intensive to solve and sometimes it is better to use heuristic approaches
for resolving large problem instances. A good heuristic should be capable of solving a problem
of region delineation, within a shorter amount of computation time, with the goal of identifying
feasible solutions as close as possible to the optimum ( Duque et al., 2007).
In this work, we take advantage of the versatility and robustness of the economic complexity
theory of Hausmann and Hidalgo and embed it into a region designing model. Thus, we propose
to draw a conceptually and theoretical link between these two subjects providing a new model with
a solid economic foundation to the 𝑝-regions family, based on Hausmann and Hidalgo’s theory
and evolutionary economics. This also allows us to incorporate new elements into Hausmann and
Hidalgo’s theory such as the role of the regions in the innovation process followed by the countries
on the PS. Also, a proved relationship between the regional division of a country and its economic
growth will open the possibilities for developing new economic-based models to allow policymakers
to: (1) identify how far is the actual regional conﬁguration of its economy from the optimal one
that would potentially foster economic growth, and (2) design industrial regions, or intraregional
agreements between administrative units, to minimize the boundary eﬀects and ease the interaction
among the key regions to promote the generation of innovation ecosystems.
3 The model
In this section we present the elements and the step-by-step assembling of the objective function of
the 𝑝-IE model. For the sake of clarity, we divide this section in 4 parts. The ﬁrst part provides
an explanation of the inputs of the model: elements of the PS (economic) and spatial elements
(geography); also, it shows how these elements are systematically incorporated into the objective
function. The second part provides a summarized statement of the optimization problem. Part three
contains the ﬁnal expression that will be maximized. Finally, in part four we illustrate the properties
of the solution of the p-IE model by means of some suitable toy examples.
3.1 Conceptual framework
Complexity theory, in this work, plays the role of giving a quantitative framework to the process of
identifying key industries. There are two types of key industries: (1) the ones that already exist and
whose interaction is central in the given economy, and (2) complex industries that are yet to appear
in the economy of interest. Our measurement tool in this case is the Product Space (PS), which
8
describes the relatedness structure between all the goods in the world (or in another macrogeographic
reference, e.g. a continent, a set of countries, etc.) and therefore provides information about classes
of key industries.
Mathematically, we will view the PS together with the complexity theory as a weighted network
of products, where the weight in the nodes gives a measure of the relevance of each good (1 the
most relevant and 0 the least relevant) and the weight in the edges gives a normalized notion of
association between any pair of goods. It is important to stress the fact that even if we consider
a weighted network built upon Hausmann and Hidalgo’s theory ( Hausmann et al. , 2014; Hidalgo
et al., 2007), any network with the properties speciﬁed above would work for our purposes.
3.1.1 First term: relatedness structure and key industrial links
The PS proposed in ( Hausmann et al. , 2014) measures the relatedness by means of the Revealed
Comparative Advantage (RCA) index introduced by Balassa ( Balassa, 1964) which is given by
RCA𝑐,𝑝 =
𝑥𝑐 𝑝/∑
𝑝 𝑥𝑐 𝑝
∑
𝑐 𝑥𝑐 𝑝/∑
𝑐,𝑝 𝑥𝑐 𝑝
Where 𝑥𝑐 𝑝 is the amount of the good 𝑝 exported by the country 𝑐 and the sums runs over all the
possible goods a countries. Given these indices for each good and each country, Hausmann et al.
(2014) deﬁnes the degree of relatedness between goods 𝑘 and 𝑙 as:
𝑦𝑙𝑚 = min{ P(RCA𝑚,𝑝 > 1| RCA𝑙,𝑝 > 1), P(RCA𝑙,𝑝 > 1| RCA𝑚,𝑝 > 1)} (1)
That is, the minimum of the conditional probability of obtaining RCA in a good given that the
country already has RCA in the other good (the minimum is taken so that the weight is undirected).
Hence, the PS is deﬁned as the undirected network (see Figure 1a) of available goods in the
world economy with links weighted by the numbers 𝑦𝑙𝑚 whenever these weights exceed a certain
threshold (see Hausmann et al., 2014, or Section 5 for a brief discussion about the determination of
the threshold).
Following the ideas of Hausmann et al. (2014) we can assess the overall production of a country
from its position on the PS. The idea consists in determining the set of goods in which the country
has revealed a comparative advantage, i.e., RCA greater than 1. We regard this set as the initial
position of the country on the graph (on the PS) and we will denote it by 𝐼𝐺 (Initial goods),
analogously we denote by 𝐼 𝐿 the set of initial links induced in the PS by 𝐼𝐺 , i.e., the links of the
PS connecting nodes belonging to 𝐼𝐺 (see Figure 1b).

Recalling the ideas discussed in the literature review about the role of regions in the formation
of clusters and on the diﬀusion on the PS, we introduce geography in this model by means of two
eﬀects: boundary eﬀect and distance decay. Since production and, subsequently, spillover eﬀects
measured by the Hausmann and Hidalgo’s theory takes place in very concrete spatial units, we
incorporate the boundary eﬀect by measuring the interaction between industries which have an
active presence within the same region. These measures are derived from two spatial inputs: the
division of the country (or the general spatial framework of reference) into areas (see Figure 2a) and
the frequency matrix 𝑓 = ( 𝑓𝑙𝑖) of the industries among the areas (see Figure 2b) (value of exports
in this case, since we follow Hausmann et al., 2014).

square of side length 1. The second part shows the distribution of 22 industries in the country. Notice that
we omit the columns corresponding to the industries 1 and 2 since the country do not produce any of them.

From the geographic distribution of the ﬁrms we compute the relative relevance of area i
producing good l (that is the share of an area in the total production, computed from Figure 2b)
𝑟𝑖𝑙 = 𝑓𝑖𝑙∑
𝑖 𝑓𝑖𝑙
(2)
We also incorporate a distance decay factor that penalizes the interaction of industries located far
away one from the other. This geographic eﬀect is justiﬁed theoretically in Hausmann and Hidalgo
(2011) by the strong eﬀect of distance in the, arguably, more important capability: knowledge. We
propose a decay function 𝑓 : [0, ∞) ↦→ [− 1, 1] of the form
𝑓 (𝑥) = 1 − 2
( 𝑥
𝑀
) 𝛼
, (3)
where 𝑀 is the maximal distance between two areas in the country and 𝛼 is the distance decay
parameter. Notice that 𝑓 (0) = 1 and that 𝑓 (𝑀) = −1. The parameter 𝛼 determines how fast the
decay function becomes negative, decaying faster when 𝛼 is greater than 1 and slower whenever 𝛼
approaches to 0 (see Section 3.4 and Section 5 for general rules to establish the value of 𝛼). Thus,
we capture the interaction between the goods 𝑙 and 𝑚 produced in the areas 𝑖 and 𝑗, respectively,
using the following expression
𝑡𝑙𝑚,𝑘
𝑖 𝑗 𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑗 𝑓 (𝑑𝑖 𝑗), (4)
where 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 is the distance between area 𝑖 and 𝑗, 𝑡𝑙𝑚,𝑘
𝑖 𝑗 is an indicator function that is 1 whenever
𝑖 and 𝑗 produce goods 𝑙 and 𝑚, respectively, and both belong to the same region 𝑘 (see Figure 3).
Hence, in a setting with 𝑛 areas and 𝑝 < 𝑛 regions, the ﬁrst term of our objective function would

where 𝑆 𝑝 is any partition of the 𝑛 areas into 𝑝 regions which in turn determine the value of the

We stress the relevance of two features in the structure of the ﬁrst term of the objective. First,
notice that we require the inverse function of the distance 𝑓 to assign negative values to penalize
long distances with negative values (see Section 3.4 for a further discussion). Second, we capture
the interaction among areas in a multiplicative way to neglect all the cases in which at least one
of the intensities is 0. This idea and the role of the indicator functions 𝑡𝑙𝑚,𝑘
𝑖 𝑗 are fully explained in
Figure 3. We describe ﬁve possible scenarios of interaction: the ﬁrst one, in which both, areas 𝑖
and 𝑗, produce two industries linked in the PS ( 𝑙 and 𝑚), yielding 2 self-interactions within each
area (𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑟𝑚𝑖 and 𝑟𝑙 𝑗𝑟𝑚 𝑗) and two unidirectional interactions between industries 𝑙 and 𝑚 across areas
(𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑗 and 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑟𝑙 𝑗 ); the second scenario exhibits one loop interaction within area i between industries
𝑙 and 𝑚 (𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑟𝑚𝑖) and the interaction between industry 𝑙 in area 𝑗 and industry 𝑚 in area 𝑖 (𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑟𝑙 𝑗 ); the
third scenario presents one unidirectional interaction; scenarios four and ﬁve show that neither the
presence of only one industry in one region nor the presence of the same industry in several areas
do not yield any interaction, respectively.

and the interaction between pairs of areas (𝑖, 𝑗 ) ) (arrows) producing linked goods (𝑙, 𝑚) in the PS.
3.1.2 Second term: complexity and target products
While the ﬁrst component enhances the interaction among the goods that already exist in the
economy, the second component is designed to maximize the probability to reach new products in
the PS that are not yet produced by the country. The construction of this second part relies in two
basic principles: (1) nodes with a bigger weight (more complex) are more desirable for the economy
and (2) the pairwise interaction of products with high association to a third non-existent good in the
economy increases the probability of the arising of this new good, whenever the interaction is given
within the same region. More generally, the problem addressed by the second term of the objective
functions lies in the general framework of a directed complex contagion problem, i.e., a diﬀusion
process on the PS in which the process can diﬀuse from several nodes to others depending on their
complexity. Such models predict a nonlinear diﬀusion, more explicitly, the probability of reaching
a new node turns out to be proportional to a power of the association with the ﬁrst order neighbors
(see Alshamsi et al. , 2018). Nonetheless, in Alshamsi et al. (2018) the contagion power for the PS
was found to be conveniently close to 1 (1.03, more precisely), enabling us to consider the sum of
pairwise interactions. Notice also that the study of contagion as a pairwise interaction of nodes is
quite reminiscent to the basic concept of clustering by triplets on networks (see e.g. the deﬁnition
of the clustering coeﬃcient in Barabási et al. , 2016). For our subsequent analysis we introduce the
notation 𝐿𝑣 for the set of (undirected links) of neighbors of 𝑣 in the PS. Notice that two nodes linked
in 𝐿𝑣 may not (but usually are) linked in the PS.
Since the non-existent goods may be far away from the set 𝐼𝐺 in the PS, we restrict our analysis
to products that can be reached after one step of diﬀusion, trying to simplify the study of more
12
complex dynamics. Also, since this component of the objective function is intended to improve the
complexity, then we deﬁne the target goods as the ones that are more complex than at least one of
their neighbors in the PS already produced by the country. Further, the spatial nature of this model
allows us to only consider complex goods whose arising requires the interaction of two or more
industries, i.e., we discard leaves of the network. We depict thoroughly these processes in Figure
4a. This set of nodes in the graph constitutes the set of target goods denoted by 𝑇𝐺 . Although
many complexity measures would work for our purposes, we want to stress that its introduction in
this model is motivated by the deﬁnition of the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) introduced in
Hausmann et al. (2014). In our case of study (see Section 5), we use a normalized version in the
unit interval of this index as a measure of complexity.

where 𝑐𝑣 is the complexity of the good 𝑣 ∈ 𝑇𝐺 , 𝑦𝑙𝑣 is the weight of the link between the goods
𝑙 and 𝑣 in the PS (equation ( 1)).
3.1.3 Assembling the objective function
So far, we have set up both components of our objective function without specifying the interplay
between them. By construction, the ﬁrst term enables us to capitalize the key industrial interactions
already formed by the natural economic forces of the country of interest. Since the second term
tries to reach as many complex goods as possible it has the tendency to group multiple areas and
create big regions while introducing volatility into the model. Thus, the ﬁrst term plays the role
of guaranteeing a reasonable size and shape of the economic regions so that key interactions are
preserved, whereas the second term is intended to “perturb” or modify the conﬁgurations suggested
by the ﬁrst term in order to maximize the complexity without making abrupt changes in regional
conﬁgurations. Hence, the next step consists in ﬁnding suitable weights in order to guarantee the
predominance of the ﬁrst term over the second one.
Notice that the terms in equations ( 5) and ( 6) are bounded from above by 2. Hence, in order to
bound this term, it is necessary to determine which is the maximum number of ways to assign 𝑛
areas into 𝑝 regions.
This problem can be phrased in terms of a maximization problem. Let 𝑧𝑖 be the number of areas
in the region 𝑖. From Figure 3 we have that each area can interact with all the areas, including itself.
So, if we count the number of interactions we have that the ﬁrst area can interact with 𝑧𝑖 areas, the
second with 𝑧𝑖 − 1 and so forth. Thus, we face the constrained optimization problem
Maximize 1
2
𝑝∑
𝑖=1
𝑧𝑖 (𝑍𝑖 − 1),
s.t.
𝑝∑
𝑖=1
𝑧𝑖 = 𝑝,
𝑧𝑖 ≥ 1.
In here, the objective function measures the number of interactions between all areas in each
region, i.e., the number of 𝑡𝑙𝑚,𝑘
𝑖 𝑗 that can be 1 assuming that all goods are produced in all the areas
and that two areas can be joined in only one region (where this latter restriction will be guaranteed by
the constraints of the model). A direct computation shows us that the solution of this maximization
problem 𝑛
2𝑝(𝑛−𝑝) . Thus, the ﬁrst component of the objective function is bounded from above by
14
𝑛
2𝑝(𝑛−𝑝) | 𝐼 𝐿| , where | 𝐼 𝐿| is the number of elements in 𝐼 𝐿. A similar reasoning applied to the second
term shows that this term is bounded from above by ℎ = 𝑛
2𝑝 (𝑛 − 𝑝) ∑
𝑣∈𝑇𝐺 | 𝐿𝑣 |(| 𝐿𝑣 | − 1).
Hence, a possible factor that guarantees the dominance of the ﬁrst term of the objective function
over the second term would be 𝑊 = 101+⌊log(ℎ)⌋ (where ⌊·⌋ is the standard ﬂoor function.) We can
also normalize the weights setting 𝑊1 = 𝑊
𝑊+1 and 𝑊2 = 1 − 𝑊1. Finally, given a 𝑝-regionalization
𝑆 𝑝 (or partition of 𝑛 areas into 𝑝 regions) we deﬁne the objective function of the 𝑝-IE by
𝑍 (𝑆 𝑝) = 𝑊1𝐹𝑇 (𝑆 𝑝) + 𝑊2𝑆𝑇 (𝑆 𝑝) (7)
3.2 Problem statement
Let 𝐼 = { 1, · · · , 𝑛} be the set of areas of a country with 𝑛 areas and let 𝑝 ∈ { 2, · · · , 𝑛 − 1} be the
prescribed number of regions. Let Π be the set of feasible 𝑝-regionalizations given by contiguous
partitions of 𝐼, i.e., collections of areas the form 𝑃𝑝 = { 𝑅1, · · · , 𝑅 𝑝} such that
• 𝑅 ≠ ∅ for 𝑅 ∈ 𝑃𝑝
• 𝑅 ∩ 𝑅′ = ∅ for any pair of distinct elements 𝑅, 𝑅′ ∈ 𝑃𝑝.
• ∪
𝑅∈𝑃 𝑝 𝑅 = 𝐼.
• Each region 𝑅 ∈ 𝑃𝑝 is connected.
The 𝑝-IE problem may be formulated as:
Determine 𝑃∗
𝑝 ∈ Π such that: 𝑍 (𝑃∗
𝑝) ≥ 𝑍 (𝑃𝑝), ∀𝑃𝑝 ∈ Π.

𝑇𝐺 ∪ 𝐼𝐺 ⊆ 𝐺;

Constraints ( 9), ( 10) and ( 11) guarantee the connectedness of each deﬁned region. These
conditions represent an extension of the ordered area assignment conditions proposed by Cova and
Church (2000) ( see also Martin and Sunley, 1996). More precisely, equation (9) forces the model to
assign only one area per region with order 0, equation ( 10) implies that each area must be assigned
with some order to some region, and equation ( 11) preserves the order of the assignment of the
areas to the regions, i.e., guarantees that an area is assigned to a region with order o only if there is
another neighboring area belonging to the same region assigned with order o-1.
Restrictions ( 12) and ( 13) provide the interaction between the regionalization ( 𝑥 𝑘𝑜
𝑖 ) and the
interaction in the product space ( 𝑡𝑙𝑚,𝑘
𝑖 𝑗 ). Equation ( 13) bounds the decision variables 𝑡𝑙𝑚,𝑘
𝑖 𝑗 so that
the model is allowed to activate them (and increase the value of the OF) when the interaction
between the goods 𝑙 and 𝑚 produced in the areas 𝑖 and 𝑗 (respectively) occurs within the same
region 𝑘 ∈ { 1, · · · , 𝑝 } , i.e., this restriction generates the trade-oﬀ in the model that guarantees
that only the most important links of the product space are preserved. On the other hand, we use
equation (13) to force the model to activate all the variables 𝑡𝑙𝑚,𝑘
𝑖 𝑗 whenever areas 𝑖 and 𝑗 are within
the same region and their interaction is penalized by the distance decay function 𝑓 so that the OF
has to pay eﬀectively for the generation of large regions. This restriction prevents the model in
producing degenerate solutions, i.e., one massive region and 𝑝 − 1 small regions. Controlling the
size of the regions through the distance decay allows us to formulate the model for any geography
without the risk of having empty feasible sets (infeasibilities). Finally, equations ( 14) and ( 15) are
integer conditions on the decision variables.
3.4 Examples
We present two examples to illustrate how our model works. In the ﬁrst example we show the
behavior of the ﬁrst term of the OF, whereas the second shows the inﬂuence of the second term on
the solution: explicitly, how the second term of the OF breaks ties in a solution reached by the ﬁrst
term, seeking to maximize complexity. In both cases, we will take as distances between areas the
Euclidean distance between the centers of the regions.

Figure 5: PS for example 1. This is the PS of the country described in Figure 2. It contains 4 clusters of
industries perfectly separated and omits industries 9, 10 and 17 which are isolated.
We will take 𝛼, i.e., the decaying parameter of the function 𝑓 in equation (3), such that it gives
zero value to the radius of the region in the scenario in which all of them have the same number of
areas 𝑛
𝑝 . Thus, since the geography in these toy examples is given by square areas in rectangular
grids (see Figure 6b and Figure 7c) we will take 𝑅𝑎𝑣 =
√
𝑛
𝑝 as the radius of an average region.
Therefore, we have that 𝛼 = 𝑙𝑛 (2)
𝑙𝑛
(
𝑀
𝑅𝑎𝑣
) .
For the ﬁrst example we suppose a country with geography and production described in Figure
2 and, therefore, we have the decaying parameter 𝛼 = 0.7564. Consider also the PS depicted in
Figure 5. Notice that the PS given in Figure 5 is a subset of the PS presented in the Figure 1,
although some links are removed or added so that we obtained 4 disconnected clusters on the graph.
Also notice that in this case the graph is entirely exhausted by the set 𝐼𝐺 , equivalently, there are
no target goods. Hence, the weights of the vertices are irrelevant for the objective function. From
the conveniently designed distribution of industries on the array, there are ﬁve spatial clusters of
industries where each one of those corresponds to one of the four connected components of the PS
in the Figure 5. Thus, for p=5 the 𝑝-IE model ﬁnds an optimal solution of the form presented in
Figure 6a.

Figure 6: This ﬁgure summarizes the output of the optimization for this example. The ﬁve shaded areas in
the ﬁrst part correspond to the optimal regions, while the color of the links in the second part indicates the
regions in which such interactions take place.
In the second example we illustrate the eﬀect of the second term. We assume a simpler scenario
where the country has nine areas with a corresponding decaying factor given by 𝛼 = 2.4094 and
faces a PS as the depicted by Figure 7b. In this case we assume that the country produces four
goods as labeled in Figure 7a so that in the purple areas goods 3 and 4 are produced with the same
intensity, goods 5 and 6 are produced with the same intensity in the green areas and good 11 is
produced in the white area. We assume that the links in the PS, particularly the one between goods
5 and 11 and the one between goods 3 and 11 are equal. Under this scenario, as we saw in the
previous example, the purple and green regions should be preserved by the ﬁrst term of the objective
function. Our attention is focused now in how the white area in the middle is assigned to one of the
two regions. Notice that the interaction between goods 5 and 11 pursues the arising of good 7 that
is more complex than good 2. Thus, we expect that a solution of the 𝑝-IE model with 𝑝 = 2 should
assign good 11 to the green region, which eﬀectively happens as we can see in the Figure 7c.

one in which 3 and 4 interact (purple) and the one in which 5 and 6 interact (green). Figure 7c presents the

5 and 6 enhancing the arising of 7 (in red).
4 The heuristic
In this section, we address the computational complexity of the 𝑝-IE problem by designing a
heuristic solution. The use of heuristic methods has been a recurrent alternative within the family
of the 𝑝-regions models ( Rosenthal and Strange , 2004; De Groot et al. , 2016; Laura et al. , 2015;
She et al. , 2017). Regardless whether it is a 𝑝-regions or a Max- 𝑝-regions problem the structure
of a heuristic for region design consists of two main blocks, (1) generate a set of initial feasible
solutions and (2) take the best initial feasible solution and improve it by using a local search process
21
based on tabu search, simulated annealing, greedy algorithm, among others (Rosenthal and Strange,
2004;Duque et al., 2007). Computational experiments made by Rosenthal and Strange (2004) show
that the tabu search performs signiﬁcantly better within the family of the 𝑝-regions problems. The
use of tabu search on an initial feasible solution is a practice that dates back to the nineties with the
seminal contribution by Opeshaw and Rao ( Openshaw and Rao, 1995).
Algorithm 4.1 presents the heuristic for the 𝑝-IE problem. The construction phase is inspired on
the “growing regions” strategy ﬁrst proposed by Vickrey (1961), which generates an initial feasible
solution in two steps: (1) select a set of p areas, which are called “seed” areas, and (2) starts assigning
neighboring unassigned areas until all areas are assigned to a region (i.e., a region “grows” around
each initial seed). There exist many variants of both steps; in our case, we select the initial seeds
using the 𝑘-means++ algorithm proposed by Arthur and Vassilvitskii (2006), which seeks a good,
spread out, location of the initial seeds. The 𝑘-means++ has a probabilistic component that allows
exploring diﬀerent sets of initial seeds. Each seed area becomes a growing region around which
the rest of the areas are assigned. For the second step, the algorithm identiﬁes the bordering areas
(unassigned areas that share a border with a growing region) and selects the one with the minimum
distance to its neighboring growing region. The distance between a bordering area 𝑖 and a growing
region GR is calculated as the sum of squared diﬀerences of the vector of exports 𝑟𝑙𝑖 and the average
vector of exports of the areas already assigned to the growing region GR (see equation ( 16)).
𝑑𝑖𝐺 𝑅 =
∑
𝑙
(𝑟𝑙𝑖 − avg(𝑟𝑙𝐺 𝑅)) 2. (16)
Each time an area is assigned to a region it is necessary to update the set of neighboring
unassigned areas and the process repeats until all areas are assigned to a region. Since the
construction of an initial feasible solution is a fast process, we generate multiple initial feasible
solutions (maxitr) and choose the one that maximizes the objective function 𝑍 (·) . The best solution,
𝑃best
𝑝 , is then passed to the next block, the local search.
The second block, the local search, uses a tabu search algorithm ( Glover, 1977; Glover, 1989
and Glover, 1990), which has shown good performance in spatial aggregation models ( Rosenthal
and Strange, 2004; Openshaw and Rao, 1995). Given a feasible solution, the neighboring solutions,
𝑁 𝑠, are obtained by moving bordering areas (i.e., areas that share a border with a neighboring
region) to neighboring regions, one at a time, while preserving feasibility. The tabu search explores
these neighboring solutions seeking improvements in the objective function 𝑍 (·) . One key aspect
of the tabu search is that it allows for a possible worsening of the objective function as a strategy
for escaping from local optima with the hope that it will lead to an even better solution. The
search stops after a predeﬁned number of non-improving moves ( convTabu). Although there exist
multiple variants of this algorithm we decided to use the simplest version because the local search
is computationally intensive and previous literature in the area of spatial clustering did not ﬁnd
clear advantages of using more sophisticated version of the tabu search algorithm ( Rosenthal and
22
Strange, 2004; Openshaw and Rao, 1995).

To illustrate the way in which each block of the tabu search contributes to ﬁnding a good solution
we present the result obtained for the example in Figure 6 which aggregates twenty areas into ﬁve
regions with an optimal objective function 𝑍 = 2.5327. To test each component (construct initial
feasible solutions and local search), we ran the tabu search twice with diﬀerent conﬁgurations: the
ﬁrst test was based upon generating 500 initial feasible solutions with the hope of ﬁnding a very
good initial solution before moving to the local search. In the second test only two initial feasible
solutions were generated. This second test relies on local search to improve the initial solution
as much as possible (hopefully to reach the optimum). In both cases, we stopped the tabu search
after ten non-improving moves ( convTabu=10). Figure 8 shows the results of both conﬁgurations.
When we explore 500 initial feasible solutions (Figure 8a) the algorithm ﬁnds a solution that takes
only four iterations of the local search to ﬁnd the optimal solution (plus ten non-improving moves
for convergence). When we generate only 2 initial feasible solutions (Figure 8b) the solution that
enters the local search is considerably further from the global optima compared to the previous
conﬁguration. In this case, the local search process requires thirteen iterations to ﬁnd the optimal
solution (plus ten non-improving moves for convergence). Note also how the local search process
escapes a local optimal between iterations 8 and 13 in Figure 8b.

5 Case of study
As an application of the 𝑝-IE model we address the problem of ﬁnding optimal industrial ecosystems
for Colombia.
5.1 Data
PS data
24
We developed a version of the PS using trade data from the Centre dÉtudes Prospectives et
d’Informatio Internationales (CEPII), which contains data for 128 countries, for the time period
1995 to 2010 and includes observations of 1,240 products classiﬁed under the nomenclature of the
Harmonized System at the 4 digit level (HS4). We computed the weights of the network using
equation (1). Following the lines of Hidalgo et al. (2007) we opt for a threshold of 0.55 to deﬁne the
PS, although there is a range of possible thresholds that would work for our purposes. Also, since
our dataset diﬀers from the one used for the computations in Hidalgo et al. (2007), we provide in
Figure 9 the respective analysis and diagnostics to justify why this election is still reasonable in our
case. In our case, we select a PS with 708 nodes that includes the basket of exports of Colombia.
Another important diﬀerence is that we have higher average degree centrality (6.823 vs 4 of the PS
in Krugman (1991)). In our case, there are 100 nodes outside of the giant component. Nevertheless,
all of them are in little components with negligible size. Thus, the connectivity and sparseness
properties are basically preserved by the giant component and we can restrict our analysis to the
latter one.
For a better visualization of our version of the PS and for the subsequent descriptive analysis
of our results we identiﬁed 7 main clusters on the graph using the standard Louvain Modularity
algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008). These clusters contain 92.92% of the nodes of the giant component.
We can also identify the position of Colombia on the PS by detecting the set of nodes in which
Colombia has RCA greater than 1. We summarize this information in Figure 10. Colombia reveals
comparative advantage in 217 goods and 187 belongs to the giant component of the PS.

(b) Average degree of centrality in the PS vs value of the
Threshold.
(c) Sparseness of the PS vs value of the Threshold.
 (d) Description of the PS when a threshold
of 0.55 is used.
Figure 9: We present how the network is becoming more informative as we increase the threshold. This is
reﬂected in how the number of nodes in Figure 4a decays slowly, while the degree centrality in Figure 4b
and the sparseness in Figure 4c decrease rapidly. With a threshold of 0.55 we have a signiﬁcant number of
nodes (708), most of them in the giant component and with small components of a negligible size (2 nodes
in average) as it is showed in Figure 4d.

 (b) Share of Colombian nodes in the PS.
Figure 10: In the ﬁrst part we depict the communities detected with the Louvains method in the giant
component of the PS and we mark in black, on top of them, the nodes in which Colombia reveal comparative
advantage. The color code of the communities and the share of Colombia in each one of them is summarized
in the second part. The order in which the communities are listed corresponds with their relative size
compared with the giant component of the PS.
Geography data
The georeferenced data required to compute the interactions between industry areas is obtained
from the open source information in Datlas tool of Bancoldex. This dataset contains the exports
per industry in HS4 and per municipality for the years 2008-2017. We use this export data
for the year 2014 to compute the distribution matrix (analogous to the one depicted in Figure
2b) and the subsequent parameters required for the 𝑝-IE model. Since several municipalities
in Colombia have a very incipient or nonexistent industry, we found zero exports for 591 out
of 1120 municipalities. We overcome this issue by merging municipalities with zero exports with
neighboring municipalities with positive exports in at least one industry. We deﬁned these new areas
by implementing the Max- 𝑝 Regions algorithm ( Duque et al. , 2012), using exports as the decision
variable. This algorithm merges municipalities into an optimal number of spatially continuous areas,
following a queen adjacency criterion, so that the distance between municipalities is minimized.
The distance function is deﬁned as the Euclidean diﬀerence of the coordinates of the centroids of
the municipalities plus the diﬀerence of the department ID of each municipality (the departments
in Colombia are regional divisions similar to the states in USA). This distance is chosen such that
the resulting regions are compact and prefer to remain within the same department (see Figure 11),
preserving geographic cohesion. Finally note that the Max- 𝑝 Regions algorithm creates new areas
27
such that only one of the member municipalities have positive exports.
(a) Municipalities with positive exports.
 (b) Areas obtained after applying the Max-p regions
model.
Figure 11: The ﬁrst part shows the map of Colombia divided in 1,120 municipalities, where 529 of them
(marked in blue) have positive exports in some industry. Second part depicts the regions obtained after
applying the Max- 𝑝 Regions algorithm to the ﬁrst part.
The distance matrix (𝑑𝑖 𝑗) is computed as the Euclidean distance between the centroids of the
resulting 529 areas. We determined the decay parameter similarly to the case of the examples in
Section 3.4. In the same manner as that case we will take the parameter such that the distance
decaying function 𝑓 vanishes at the radius of an average region of size 𝑛
𝑝 . However, since the
geography in this case is less rigid, we assume that the optimal regions could resemble more a circle
than a square. Hence, we will take 𝑅𝑎𝑣 =
√
𝑛
𝜋 𝑝 as the radius of an average region and 𝑀 = 1, 382.2
km. Therefore, we have that 𝛼 = ln(2)
ln
(
𝑀
𝑅𝑎𝑣
) .

Results
We solved the 𝑝-IE model using our heuristic for a range of values of 𝑝 between 10 and 90
as depicted in Figure 12. Since the heuristic algorithm (at least in the ﬁrst stage) behaves like a
clustering algorithm we opted for a simple application of the Elbow method to select a ﬁrst candidate
for the optimal number of regions. From this analysis we determined 40 as our ﬁrst candidate.

Figure 12: In the ﬁrst part we show how the optimal value of the objective function behaves in the number
of regions and depicts how the slope starts to ﬂatten signiﬁcantly for big values of 𝑝. In part two we depict
the behavior of the objective function, detecting that the biggest variation in the slope occurs at 𝑝=40.
However, the solution corresponding to 𝑝=40 has 15 singletons (regions constituted by one
area). Diﬀerent implementations of our model for smaller scenarios suggest that when the number
of regions is high, the model has the tendency to isolate areas with less valuable interactions turning
them into singletons so that the most valuable interactions are preserved within the bigger regions.
This and several discussions with policy makers willing to implement this model in the Colombian
case made us opt for a regional division without singletons so that we proposed to reduce the number
of regions such that each singleton is incorporated into a bigger region. For this reason, we propose
the model for Colombia with 𝑝=25. For this value of 𝑝 we have a decaying power 𝛼 = 0.20041 and
a conﬁguration as depicted by Figure 13. We classify these regions according to their share in the
total amount of exports of Colombia during 2014. We chose this classiﬁcation to be consistent with
the metrics of localization and of the PS that were based upon the export data. Table 1 provides
an initial description of the geographic characteristics of the regions and the corresponding export
share for each one of them.
29
Figure 13: This ﬁgure depicts the solution for p=25 classifying the resultant regions with colors and labels.
We label them in decreasing order with respect to their share in the total exports of Colombia in 2014 (see
Table 1).
In Table 2 we summarize some relevant properties of the regions from the perspective of the
Hausmann and Hidalgo’s theory. The ﬁrst two metrics correspond to a measure of the size of
the subgraph spanned by each region within the PS. The column of industries shows how many
industries of the giant component of the PS are produced in the region. The second column
corresponds to the sparseness of each subgraph (see Barabási et al., 2016), i.e., for a region with 𝑁
industries and 𝐿 links among these industries its sparseness is given by 2𝐿
𝑁 (𝑁−1) .
This also provides a sort of measure of the extent of interaction among key industries inside the
region. The third metric indicates the relevance of the goods produced within the region as stepping
stones in the PS. We compute the fraction of shortest paths between any pair of nodes passing
through the nodes of the region, i.e., the group betweeness centrality for these nodes (see Brandes,
2001). This measure gauges the extent in which goods produced in the region are determinant
in the diﬀusion processes on the PS. The fourth column is a weighted average of the normalized
complexities of the goods produced within the region. More explicitly, for a region 𝑅 producing
the set of goods 𝑃 (a subset of the PS) we consider the complexity measure

Table 2: Summary of some attributes computed for each region for the solution corresponding to 𝑝=25.
32
We want to point out that some strange features of this solution are a direct consequence of the
Colombian export structure. For example, the large region 10 is formed by 58 areas where 10 of of
the municipalities make up 70% of its size in PS; this reﬂects the absence of exports (or signiﬁcant
exports) in this part of the country and precludes us to deﬁne ﬁner divisions. Another example
is given by region 20. This region only exports one good in which Colombia has a comparative
advantage (coﬀee beans), though this good has small betweness centrality and complexity values.
These two radical cases show the main reasons that could force the model to deviate from expected
solutions: gathering areas into macro-regions or deﬁning regions specialized in goods with low
complexity.
Analysis of regions 1 and 3
We conclude our analysis of the output with a comparison between region 1 and region 3. We
choose these two for two reasons (1) both have a relatively similar size in Km 2; (2) the exports
structure of both regions are distinct enough so that we can exemplify with them two types of
regions in Colombia: regions following a diversiﬁcation strategy (region 3) and regions specialized
in agriculture or extractive economic activities (region 1).
In Figure 14 and Figure 15 we provide a thorough description of region 1 and region 3 that may
be useful for policy making if we regard them as innovation ecosystems. We provide a detailed
account of the exports of each region in the form of tree diagrams in part (c) of each ﬁgure. These
diagrams are classiﬁed according to the communities identiﬁed and described in Figure 10b. It is
worth noting that these communities do not follow any standard industrial classiﬁcation, but are
completely determined with clustering methods (Louvain algorithm). Thus, it is possible to have
industries which do not seem to belong to the corresponding productive sector. The size of the
boxes within each category are weighted by the betweness centrality (BC) of the industry as a node
in the PS. As discussed before, the BC tells us how central a node is in the diﬀusion of a country on
the PS. Actually, we may think of them as stepping-stones in the process of reaching more valuable
or complex nodes. Thus, since region 1 and region 3 are intended to foster innovation processes
over the short and long run, policy makers should focus not only on the complex goods, but in those
which are essential to move towards them.
Region 1 is specialized in the reﬁnement of petroleum and contributes 18% of the 44% of the
share of the petroleum in Colombian exports. Even more dramatically, the origin of this export
is concentrated in one city into region 1 (Barrancabermeja) which has one of the most important
reﬁneries of the country. On top of this, after taking the subset of goods that belong to the PS with
the prescribed threshold (which excludes the petroleum) we see that region 1 is still specialized in
the production of commodities such as melons and tomatoes (see Figure 14c). In contrast, region
3 has relatively strong industries contributing signiﬁcantly in the production of complex goods
(reaction & catalytic products, acrylic polymers, other rubber products, etc.) combined with the
production of commodities (in the rural parts of the region) such as fermented milk, cheese and so
forth (see Figure 15c).
33
The graphic information provided in parts (b) and (c) of Figure 14 and Figure 15 enables us to
give a more detailed answer to the issue of determining the current situation of the region. In fact,
from Table 2 we already know the average complexity, the number of industries and how central
the goods of each region on average are. From Figure 14 and Figure 15 we can explain in what
sense region 3 is more complex and more central (on average) than region 1. Since the boxes in
the tree diagrams in Figure 14c and Figure 15c also contain information about the complexity of
goods normalized between 0 and 1 (Comp) and the share of the country in total exports of each
good of the country during that year (Sh), we can easily observe that products in region 3 account
for both a large share of exports and a high complexity (in contrast with region 1). On top of this,
the network of available and target goods rendered in part (b) of Figure 14 and Figure 15 allow us to
see how likely existing industries will thrive. For example, we point out that in region 3 the clusters
of Clothing and fabrics and Chemicals are bigger and better connected than in region 1. This is of
particular interest in terms of complexity since the cluster of Chemicals in each region contains (in
average) more complex goods than the other clusters.
Finally, we present prospective strategies of innovation for each region. Our implementation of
the 𝑝-IE model ﬁnds 25 target nodes for Colombia. All 25 targets are described in Table 3 together
with their respective complexity values and the probability of each of the two regions explored to
introduce these new goods in their economy. These probabilities are computed as a weighted sum
of the following type
Prob Reg 𝑗 (𝑣) =
∑
𝑖∈𝑅 𝑗
∑
𝑙∈𝑃 𝑟𝑖𝑙 𝑦𝑙𝑣
∑
𝑙∈𝑃 𝑦𝑙𝑣
. (18)
where v is the target good, 𝑅 𝑗 is the set of areas forming the region 𝑗 (for 𝑗=1,2). This
computation is a linearized and continuous version of the formula proposed by Alshamsi et al.
(2018). Since our computations use as inputs shares of the regions with respect to the total
production of the country, these probabilities must be understood in a relative way, i.e., how likely
a region is to develop comparative advantage in a good with respect to another. We notice that
region 3 has a positive probability to branch into all 25 products, whereas region 1 only exhibits 21
products with positive probability. We can illustrate how to use this information with two simple
examples. Combining parts (b) and (c) of Figure 14 and Figure 15 with Table 3 we notice that
region 3 has a considerably higher probability of developing comparative advantage in the last 4
goods listed in Table 3 because all of them are highly related to goods that are intensively produced
by region 3 and that belong to the cluster of Clothing and fabrics which is highly connected in this
region. On the other hand, the most complex target good (fork-Lifts) has a considerably higher
probability to be produced in region 3 compared with region 1. This diﬀerence underscores the fact
that region 3 produces a signiﬁcantly higher share of the products in the cluster of Metals related to
forklifts in the PS as we can see in Figure 15b and Figure 15c, respectively.

Figure 15: This ﬁgure is analogous to Figure 14. We want to stress the fact that the PS of region 1 depicted
by Figure 15b is a strict subset of the one depicted in Figure 14b. In particular, region 3 has a larger set of
available and target nodes. Also, it is important to notice the change in the composition of the tree map in
Figure 15c with respect to the one in Figure 15c.

6 Conclusions
In this paper we introduced a new member of the𝑝-regions clustering methods called the𝑝-Innovation
Ecosystems (p-IE) model. This model adds a new layer of complexity into the set of 𝑝-regions
models incorporating an underlying network structure that captures possible interactions between
agents within the geographic areas. The main application (and motivation) of the model is the study
of the evolution of the economic output based on recent developments of economic complexity and
evolutionary economic theory. More precisely, this model consists in the aggregation of n areas into
p spatially contiguous regions that (1) maximizes the number of relevant interactions among the
industries within the same region; and (2) identify strategic relationships between industries within
regions that maximize the probability of activating innovation processes that allow the region to
jump to more complex relevant goods yet to appear in the economy. Formally, the 𝑝-IE model was
formulated as MIP problem with a corresponding heuristic solution. From the economic point of
view, we introduced this model as an application and extension of the theory of Hausmann and
Hidalgo (done at the level of countries) to the study of the industrial evolution at regional levels.
From the perspective of policy development, we introduced several metrics as well as suggested
how they might be applied in conjunction with the 𝑝-IE model. This approach will help policy
makers diagnose and assess the actual performance of the economic regions and the potential
performance of each of the regionalizations proposed by the model. We introduced these ideas
in a case of study for the municipalities of Colombia and were able to identify 25 innovation
ecosystems, which we ranked according to their contribution to the total exports of Colombia. We
found a positive association between the complexity of these regions, their level of exports and
the growth of their level of exports. Also, a further analysis applied to the ﬁrst and third regions
(according to our classiﬁcation) showed how to obtain inputs that would help the policy makers
design policies to exploit the current situation of the regions (amount of production) and to enhance
the production of key industries in the innovation process (with high betweenness centrality) so that
the target industries (with a high complexity) arise within the regions.
As it is formulated, the p-IE model can be implemented to other clustering problems as long
as the situation can be described in terms of two inputs: (1) distribution of areas inside a region
which contain agents or attributes of some sort, (2) a network structure that relates the agents or
attributes identifying the most important attributes or agents and the key interactions among them.
We suggest two alternative applications of this model. First, given an input-output matrix (of
money transfers among industries) we could use the model to produce optimal regions so that the
policy maker can identify the supply chains, preserve them within the resulting regions and design
strategies to complete the chains inside the regions. Second, we can think in a scenario involving
a network of amenities in a city (such as hospitals, schools, museums, gas stations, etc.) and the
commuting ﬂows or connectivity ﬂows weighting the links among them. In this case, it would
be possible to apply the model to divide the city into optimal zones in which a citizen could ﬁnd
well-connected and complementary sets of amenities. The model also could be used to identify
the lacking amenities within each zone and measure the extent to which a given zone is not yet
self-contained or self-suﬃcient. This kind of exercise would be a relevant contribution to solve
38
mobility issues and to promote the use of non-motorized transport methods.
Our approach in this paper is static by nature; therefore, its usefulness may vary when the
underlying economic and network structure change. Furthermore, since the main application of this
model is intended to enhance the economic growth and the innovation through the implementation
of local policies, it is necessary to better understand the behavior of the model in dynamic scenarios;
namely, when many target goods are reached and a new regionalization is required to guarantee
the optimality of the solution, or when the aims of the policy makers are directed to a speciﬁc set
of industries rather than the ones dictated by the economic complexity. This extension is the main
topic of a forthcoming paper.
