Abstract
Spatial regionalization partitions a set of spatial polygons into con-
tiguous, non-overlapping regions that optimize a specific objective
function. This spatial operation serves diverse applications in envi-
ronmental science, urban planning, public health, and economics.
Due to the NP-hardness of this problem, most studies rely on heuris-
tics and approximation techniques to balance solution quality with
runtime efficiency. This tutorial reviews the main methods in the
literature of spatial regionalization, organizing them into four cate-
gories: (i) linear and integer-programming formulations, (ii) top-
down divisive strategies, (iii) bottom-up agglomerative strategies,
and (iv) learning-based methods. For each category, we outline the
core ideas and representative algorithms. We also discuss the open
problems and future research directions.

1 Overview
Spatial regionalization is the problem of partitioning a spatial space
into contiguous regions that optimize a chosen objective. It is widely
utilized across various domains, including public health [ 8], e.g.,
delineating epidemic outbreak zones, environmental science [37],
e.g., identifying homogeneous climate zones for climate change
studies, and public policy [11, 12], e.g., school redistricting.
Spatial regionalization problems exhibit various forms, primarily
differentiated by their input/output, constraints, and objective func-
tions, yet all are NP-hard constrained optimization problems. One
key distinction is whether the number of regions is predetermined
as input or dynamically determined by the algorithm and produced

as output. When the number of regions is input, the problem for-
mulation is referred to as the p-regions problem [5, 18, 24, 26, 29].
Conversely, when the optimal number of regions is part of the so-
lution to the optimization problem itself, the formulation is called
the max-p regions problem [2, 3, 17, 19, 20, 22, 32–35].
Objective functions in spatial regionalization also vary consid-
erably, fundamentally influencing the resulting region boundaries.
Many algorithms measure heterogeneity as the sum of pairwise at-
tribute dissimilarities within each region [2, 17, 18, 22, 29, 35], while
others use deviations from a regional mean [ 6, 7]. Beyond these
generic metrics, application-specific designs tailor the objective to
domain goals. School redistricting systems such as REGAL [ 12]
and SPATIAL [11] combine capacity balance with student travel
distance to yield equitable, short-commute districts. Mobility and
economic studies favor flow-modularity measures that keep com-
muter or freight movements largely inside each region [ 10, 25].
This tutorial emphasizes the general heterogeneity functions while
noting these domain-driven variants.
User-defined constraints also play in categorizing regionalization
problems. PRUC formulation [29], for example, enriches the stan-
dard p-regions problem by supporting an aggregate user-defined
constraint, thereby increasing practical applicability. Similarly, EMP
formulation [22] significantly expands the classic max-𝑝 problem
by supporting multiple simultaneous constraints, enabling users
to use all the SQL aggregate functions. Such enriched constraints
broaden the range of real-world planning scenarios that regional-
ization algorithms can capture while still allowing heuristic solvers
to scale.
Spatial regionalization is naturally relevant to the ACM SIGSPA-
TIAL conference audience [2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 27]. The audience of
this tutorial will learn a comprehensive overview about the litera-
ture of spatial regionalization with in-depth technical details and
discussions of challenges either from the algorithmic point of view
(computing challenges) or from the application point of view (inter-
disciplinary challenges). We divide the existing regionalization algo-
rithms into four categories.(i) Linear/integer programming mod-
els [15, 18, 23] that cast objectives and constraints as linear equa-
tions to provideexact solutions with solvers such as CPLEX.(ii) Top-
down divisive approaches [6, 7, 21] that provide approximate so-
lutions by starting with the whole space and iteratively divide it to
yield successively finer, homogeneous regions.(iii) Bottom-up ag-
glomerative heuristics [2, 3, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 29–31, 35] that
provide approximate solutions by merging small adjacent polygons
to form larger regions. (iv) Learning-based methods [27, 28, 36]

that find approximate solutions by training machine-learning mod-
els, typically graph or embedding networks, to embed polygons
and then cluster them under contiguity constraints.
Figure 1 summarizes the two major categorizations used in this
tutorial. Throughout this manuscript, the terms spatial polygons,
spatial units, and spatial areas are used interchangeably where the
context allows clear interpretation. The rest of this section briefly
outlines each part.
1.1 Part 1: Spatial Regionalization Formulations
Part 1 begins by introducing classical spatial regionalization prob-
lems, followed by their variants concerning constraints and ob-
jective functions. As shown in Figure 1, spatial regionalization
problems generally fall into two broad categories: (i) The 𝑝-regions
formulations [18, 26, 29], in which the analyst specifies a fixed
number of regions ( 𝑝) in advance. The objective is to partition
spatial units into exactly 𝑝 regions, minimizing internal hetero-
geneity regarding selected attributes. (ii) The max- 𝑝 regions for-
mulations [2, 3, 17, 19, 22, 35] treat the number of regions as an
outcome of the optimization process itself. Therefore, the goal is to
identify the maximum number of feasible regions, each satisfying
minimum size or other feasibility constraints.
Various objective functions quantify intra-region heterogeneity
in these formulations. Some methods define heterogeneity using
pairwise attribute differences among all spatial units within a re-
gion, effectively summing up the dissimilarities between every pair
of constituent units [
2, 17, 18, 22, 29, 35]. Other approaches measure
heterogeneity as deviations from a regional mean or centroid [6, 7],
summing the differences between each spatial unit’s attribute val-
ues and the regional average. Although differing mathematically,
these functions all aim to form internally homogeneous regions
based on chosen attributes.
Different formulations impose different constraints. For instance,
PRUC [29] augments 𝑝-regions with a single user-defined aggre-
gate threshold (e.g., minimum population) per region. Enriched
Max-P (EMP) [22] expands max-p to support multiple simultane-
ous aggregate constraints, effectively allowing any SQL-style sum,
count, or average condition within each region. These enriched
formulations let analysts encode realistic policy rules while keeping
the underlying optimization framework scalable.
1.2 Part 2: Exact Algorithms
A foundational approach to spatial regionalization is formulating
it as an exact optimization problem, typically using a linear pro-
gramming model [15, 18, 23]. This formulation is proposed in [18]
where constraints and objectives are formulated as linear equations.
Recent advancements [15] revise the linear formulation by using
fewer variables in modeling the spatial contiguity, greatly reducing
memory footprint. The linear model is solved using optimization
tools such as CPLEX [1]. However, exact solutions via linear pro-
gramming are computationally impractical for large datasets due to
the NP-hard nature of the problem. In practice, exact optimization is
affordable for a few hundred spatial units, sufficient for detailed case
studies or for validating heuristic quality, but becomes prohibitive
for larger-sized datasets.
1.3 Part 3: Top-down Divisive Algorithms
Top-down divisive methods [6, 7, 21] begin by considering all spatial
units as a single region and iteratively divide them into increasingly
homogeneous subregions. Typically, these methods model the spa-
tial units as nodes within a spatial neighborhood graph, with edges
representing adjacency. A common strategy involves transforming
this graph into a spanning tree and iteratively removing edges to
partition the graph into clusters. For instance, the Spatial ’K’luster
Analysis by Tree Edge Removal (SKATER) algorithm [6] constructs
a minimum spanning tree (MST) using edge weights based on dis-
similarity between adjacent units. SKATER progressively cuts edges
that significantly reduce within-region heterogeneity until the de-
sired number of regions is achieved. SKATER-CON [7], an extension
of SKATER, generates multiple random MSTs, applies SKATER to
each tree, and integrates these results into a final consensus re-
gionalization. REDCAP [21] is a special case that combines both
bottom-up and top-down strategies. It first applies a dynamically
constrained agglomerative phase that heuristically merges neigh-
boring units to build a spatially contiguous hierarchy, and then
partitions that hierarchy by removing edges that mostly reduce
within-region heterogeneity.
1.4 Part 4: Bottom-up Agglomerative
Algorithms
Bottom-up algorithms are widely used for spatial regionalization,
forming regions by merging smaller spatial areas (polygons) into
larger contiguous clusters. These algorithms typically employ a
two-phase heuristic: an initial solution construction phase to es-
tablish feasible regions, followed by an heuristic search phase to
optimize region boundaries [
2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 29–
31, 35, 38]. In the initial solution phase, spatial areas are selected as
seeds and expanded into preliminary regions while ensuring conti-
guity. The optimization phase then iteratively reassigns or swaps
areas between regions to improve the objective function. Variations
among these methods include different approaches to seed selec-
tion [2, 11, 12, 17, 29], heuristics guiding areas reassignment [29–
31, 35], and supported constraints or criteria [17, 18, 22, 29].
The foundational bottom-up method, AZP [ 30], begins with
a random partition and employs local greedy search, transfer-
ring neighboring boundary units between regions whenever such
moves improve the objective. To avoid local optima, subsequent
improvement [
31] introduces heuristics, including Tabu Search
and Simulated Annealing, enabling occasional acceptance of in-
ferior solutions for overall improvement. ARISeL [16] further op-
timizes initial seeding by strategically selecting dispersed initial
seeds, yielding more robust starting partitions and enhancing final
outcomes. Similarly, GSLO [29] selects spatially dispersed seeds
and employs parallel computation alongside combined heuristic
search strategies for significantly improved efficiency. The bottom-
up methods are also broadly utilized in max-𝑝 regionalization prob-
lems [2, 3, 17, 19, 22, 35], aiming to maximize region count under
given constraints by growing from the seeded regions. Variations of
such include compactness requirements [
19], simultaneous multiple
constraints [22], and efficient heuristic methods for large-scale ap-
plications [2, 3]. Domain-specific adaptations such as REGAL [12]
and SPATIAL [11] apply bottom-up agglomeration to specialized
contexts, e.g., school districting.
1.5 Part 5: Learning-based Algorithms
Learning-based spatial regionalization algorithms employ modern
representation-learning techniques, most commonly graph neural
networks (GNNs), to discover regions. A typical two-step pattern
first learns low-dimensional embeddings for each spatial polygon
on an adjacency graph that encodes contiguity, then clusters the em-
beddings while enforcing that only neighbouring units can merge.
Region2Vec [27, 28] follows this paradigm: they train an unsu-
pervised GNN whose loss jointly rewards attribute similarity and
interaction intensity between adjacent polygons, and subsequently
apply a contiguity-constrained linkage to obtain regions. MNCD-
KE [36] adopts a related two-stage strategy: a multilayer commu-
nity detector generates “kernel” units that are already cohesive in
both attributes and flows, after which a kernel-extension heuristic
greedily grows each seed while respecting contiguity, size, and
compactness constraints.
1.6 Part 6: Open Problems and Future Research
Spatial regionalization research faces two key challenges. First, the
lack of a unified query framework. Such a framework would accept
arbitrary user-defined constraints and automatically select or com-
pose the optimal solution strategy. Currently, each problem variant
relies on a specialized algorithm, forcing practitioners to manually
align problem requirements with specific code bases. A prototype
of such a framework was introduced in [4], but it remains limited,
lacking comprehensive support for diverse workloads and objec-
tive functions. Second, the absence of standardized benchmarks
and datasets. Most studies use customized datasets and evaluation
metrics, hindering consistent comparisons across algorithms. Fi-
nally, recent work [13, 14] suggest that quantum computing could
tackle the combinatorial explosion inherent in spatial regionaliza-
tion by exploring large solution spaces more efficiently than classi-
cal heuristics. Integrating quantum optimization could open a new
path toward globally optimal yet tractable spatial rationalization.
