  Various spatial data analyses have been used for the identification of functional
  regions. Functional regions are identified by grouping many areal units into fewer
  clusters to classify the areal units in terms of similar properties, as well as
  to constrain the spatial contiguity of the areal units in each cluster. This article
  proposes a spatial optimization model, called the p-functional regions problem,
  to solve a regionalization problem by considering geographic flows. The magnitude
  of geographic flows, such as journey-to-work, is widely considered a good indicator
  of functional relationships between areas so that regionalization models incorporating
  various criteria, such as the maximum intraregion flows or the total inflows from
  other units, may be used to identify the p regions. We also propose an analytical
  target reduction approach to enhance the model tractability in generating optimal
  solutions to large problems and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimization
  model using journey-to-work data from Seoul (South Korea) and South Carolina (the

  ## Introduction

  <block id="1">

  The concept of functional regions provides a framework for investigating the structure
  of geographic space. A functional region is characterized by the agglomeration of
  economic activities at a regional center that focuses people’s movements from the
  surrounding vicinities or hinterland. The center in a functional region is often
  referred to as a central place or central business district (CBD), the size of which,
  in terms of economic activity, depends on the range of goods and services provided
  (Berry and Garrison 1958). A functional region is generally described in terms of
  the structure of spatial interactions, which helps delineate regions naturally by
  maximizing the difference between within-region and between-region interactions
  (Noronha and Goodchild 1992). Thus, the pattern of geographic flows is viewed as
  an effective indicator for understanding how people’s economic activities are structured
  over space (Taaffe, Gauthier, and O’Kelly 1996). For example, daily commuting flows
  are generally manifested in the spatial structure of urban activity: because population
  flows represent the economic activities of regions, many zoning systems have used
  flow data to design zones (see Masser and Brown 1975; Masser and Scheurwater 1980;
  Rosing and ReVelle 1986; Noronha and Goodchild 1992; Alvanides, Openshaw, and Duke-Williams
  2000).


  This article is motivated by the practical and empirical need in geography and planning
  to identify functional regions and delineate their hinterland. Theoretically, a
  region may be composed of a single core functional unit and other units, or the
  region can develop multiple centers as economic activities diversify and are extended
  through the evolution of transportation systems. Functional centers may serve as
  growth poles that structure changes in labor markets and service areas in urban
  systems (Coombes et al. 1979; Schwanen, Deileman, and Dijst 2003). Finding evidence
  of multiple functional centers is key to understanding central place theory. The
  delineation of subregions with identified functional centers is usually accomplished
  using the population size of and spatial interactions among units because the influential
  area of a labor market is formed according to the level of access from the vicinity
  to the center (Berry and Garrison 1958). These functional regions can be captured
  at geographic scales ranging from CBDs within a city (e.g., Song and Kim 2015) to
  daily urban systems at a national level (Green 1958; Coombes et al. 1979; van der
  Laan 1998; Schwanen, Deileman, and Dijst 2003).


  Delimiting functional regions usually involves aggregating small areal units into
  fewer clusters, which are usually based on spatial contiguity and maintaining similar
  properties between the areal units in each cluster (Brown and Holmes 1971). More
  formally, the problem can be defined as the identification of a set of p groups
  that are aggregated into n areal units while optimizing a predefined objective function
  with a given set of criteria or constraints. Objective functions can be formulated
  to minimize the dissimilarity of areal units or to maximize their similarity. The
  criteria for achieving the best representation may include contiguity, compactness,
  or socioeconomic homogeneity (Hess et al. 1965; Morrill 1981; Williams 1995). In
  this regard, the delimitation of functional regions can be directly interpreted
  as a special case of the p-regions problem (Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011).


  An important issue, from a planning perspective, is how to effectively formulate
  the regionalization problem mathematically. Traditionally, location–allocation formulations
  have been emphasized, beginning with Hess et al. (1965). The authors applied location–allocation
  formulations to political districting problems because the model structure of location–allocation
  problems is similar to that of regionalization. All demands (from the areal units)
  are forced to be exclusively assigned to facilities (centers) and the objective
  function is similarly prescribed based on spatial efficiency, for example, the sum
  of distances (similarity) from areal units to centers is minimized (Hess et al.
  1965; Zoltners and Sinha 1983; Murray and Estivill-Castro 1998). However, the location–allocation
  approach does not always guarantee the spatial contiguity of the regions (Mehrotra,
  Johnson, and Nemhauser 1998; Cova and Church 2000). Recently, several researchers
  have included an explicit contiguity requirement as a constraint in spatial regionalization
  optimization models (Shirabe 2009; Salazar-Aguilar, Ríos-Mercado, and Cabrera-Ríos
  2011; Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011). While the contiguity constraints have
  produced contiguous regions in previous research, the location of a center in each
  region may not be structured. If a regionalization problem involves identifying
  urban or regional systems or delimiting areas such as labor markets or commuting
  sheds, then the problem should be formulated such that the functional centers of
  the regions in the solution is to be determined. In addition, it is important to
  determine how many functional regions exist in the regionalization problem. Although
  the determination of an ideal number of regions or functional centers can be modeled
  as an endogenous process in an optimization model, the computational complexity
  is high even for a problem with a small numbers of areal units, often resulting
  in intractable solutions (e.g., see Shirabe 2009; Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011).
  Alternatively, if intractability is a problem, an appropriate number of regions
  can be determined by exploring all solutions for p, which can be simply prescribed
  by explicitly formulating the constraints in the model.


  Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to develop a spatial optimization scheme
  to model the p-functional regionalization problem and to suggest an efficient method
  for the exact solution of the problem. The proposed model simultaneously determines
  a given number of functional centers and delimits their boundaries, while explicitly
  incorporating contiguity constraints. The article begins with a review of mathematical
  models for functional regionalization. The second section reviews functional regionalization
  based on existing mathematical models. The third section provides the model specifications
  for delimitating functional regions and the fourth section presents the preliminary
  results of the model. The fifth section introduces an efficient solution approach
  called analytical target reduction (ATR) to find an optimal solution for larger
  sized regionalization problems. Concluding remarks are made in the final section.

  ## Background

  <block id="2">

  A vast amount of literature on districting and regionalization exists in operations
  research. Zoltners and Sinha (1983), Williams (1995), and Duque, Romas, and Surinach
  (2007) have written review articles in the field. Here, we focus on studies on functional
  regionalization with contiguity constraints. Functional regionalization was initially
  motivated by interest in spatial systems, urban structures, and related regional
  policy and planning (e.g., Berry and Garrison 1958; Masser and Brown 1975). Functional
  regions are generally defined based on a greater magnitude of interactions or connections
  among spatial units within a region than with units outside the region (Brown and
  Holmes 1971). Therefore, the delimitation of functional regions involves the aggregation
  of small areal units into larger clusters based on spatial interaction flows such
  as journey-to-work and interstate migration. In addition, spatial interactions are
  considered a proxy for the ‘‘functional distances’’ that separate the areal units
  (Brown and Horton 1970). Early studies that used spatial interactions to delimit
  functional regions include those by Brown and Holmes (1971), Masser and Brown (1975),
  and Masser and Scheurwater (1980). Although many conceptual principles were developed
  in these studies, the operational approaches were restricted due to computational
  limitations on linear programming at that point in time.


  In general, the delimitation of functional regions can be considered a special type
  of regionalization. A simple approach is to use conventional clustering or partitioning
  methods instead of formulating mathematical models (see Openshaw 1973; Masser and
  Brown 1975; Fischer 1980; Masser and Scheurwater 1980). Such methods often require
  additional processes for ensuring the spatial contiguity of the outcome regions
  (Openshaw and Wymer 1995). These regionalization methods have also been extended
  to achieve compactness of the outcome regions (Hess et al. 1965; George, Lamar,
  and Wallace 1997). Multiobjective models have also been developed (Wise, Haining,
  and Ma 1997), some of which contain constraints to ensure the spatial contiguity
  of the outcome regions (e.g., Zoltners and Shinha 1983; Duque 2004). However, because
  the addition of constraints for spatial contiguity can dramatically increase the
  complexity of the problem, exact optimization solutions have been limited in practice
  to small n cases. Alternatively, relaxed solution frameworks can be considered if
  the locations of the centers are known (Shirabe 2009) or if the seeds of regions
  can be prespecified (Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011; Salazar-Aguilar, Ríos-Mercado,
  and Cabrera-Ríos 2011). Heuristic methods, such as greedy algorithms (Openshaw 1977),
  simulated annealing, and Tabu search (Openshaw and Rao 1995; Bozkaya, Erkut, and
  Laporte 2003; Bozkaya et al. 2011; Duque, Anselin, and Rey 2012), are typically
  employed when global optimal solutions are unattainable because of the complexity
  of the model. However, heuristic approaches may require contextual knowledge of
  the areas studied to achieve the best results.


  As previously discussed, the main issues in functional regionalization include (1)
  the objectives of the model relative to the spatial context being modeled, (2) spatial
  contiguity, and (3) the tractability of the model in terms of providing an optimal
  solution. The objective function of regionalization problems is a critical component
  of the model formulation. The objective function must reflect the spatial context
  which is being modeled by the optimization process. The effectiveness of a model
  is normally evaluated by the extent to which the regions identified by the model
  have more socioeconomic attributes within a regional grouping than between that
  group and other groupings (Gordon 1999; Cova and Church 2000; Shirabe, 2009). For
  example, if a model is concerned with spatial efficiency in delineating regions,
  then the objective function can be formulated to minimize the sum of all distances
  from the functional spatial unit (i.e., the centroid of the spatial units) to other
  spatial units within the region (Hess et al. 1965; Hess and Samuels 1971; Murray
  and Estivill-Castro 1998). By contrast, if the model addresses spatial interactions
  such as geographic flows, the goal is to focus on interregional dissimilarity relative
  to the intraregional intensity of flows. The objective function is then to maximize
  intraregional flows or to minimize interregional flows to determine the regionalization
  of the spatial units (Plane 1982; Rosing and ReVelle 1986; Alvanides, Openshaw,
  and Duke-Williams 2000). Many studies have formulated various types of objective
  functions, but few have discussed the implications of the findings based on such
  objective functions. For example, many zoning process models delineate political
  districts or traffic zones using socioeconomic data (e.g., demographic attributes)
  and spatial interactions (e.g., commuting flows). Here, the concern is the interpretation
  of where and why a particular geographic area is identified as a functional center,
  as well as how well the model captures the existing spatial context of the area
  being studied (Morrill 1981; Williams 1995). In classical location theories, a region
  is characterized by a functional center (central place), which possesses high-frequency
  interactions with and its hinterland (Christaller 1966; Lösch 1938). If functional
  centers are the inflow-dominant units within the delineated region, then these units
  should represent an administrative unit, a population center, or a service center
  that provides a major source of job opportunities. By contrast, outflow-dominant
  units can be characterized as residential or suburban areas where people commute
  to selected functional centers (Yeates 1963).


  Second, as a geographic criterion in regionalization problems, spatial contiguity
  is regarded as an important condition for eliminating the possibility that a region
  is made up of spatially discontinuous clusters. In general, a region consists of
  areal units with homogenous characteristics and is distinguished from other regions.
  However, a region can be fragmented when there are strong interactions between distant
  spatial units. For example, in air transportation, major passenger flows are often
  formed among the dominant functional regions (i.e., hub cities) based on some hierarchical
  structure, but the spatial units of a grouped region are not necessarily spatially
  contiguous (Nystuen and Dacey 1961; Wheeler and Mitchelson 1989). In contrast, if
  a region should be delineated based on geographic flows, such as commuting flows
  in ground transportation, then the delimitation process for the regions involves
  a contiguity restriction, and a functional center is nested within its surroundings
  with no fragmentation (Berry and Garrison 1958). The process of identifying the
  functional regions with contiguity can also be applied to administrative boundaries.
  For example, metropolitan statistical areas are grouped as population core areas
  surrounded by counties, which have social and economic ties that are measured by
  commuting flows to workplaces (White House 2009). In this context, the contiguity
  requirement is prescribed explicitly by a constraint in a regionalization model
  (Garfinkel and Nemhauser 1970; Mehrotra, Johnson, and Nemhauser 1998; Duque, Romas,
  and Surinach 2007). From a modeling perspective, spatial contiguity is often translated
  into a network tree generation problem to check the validity of contiguity. Areal
  units and their adjacency relationships are expressed as nodes and edges in terms
  of a graph, such that a region is verified as contiguous only if there is at least
  one path connecting all the spatial units within the region or if all the spatial
  units within the region are connected to the tree structure. However, spatial contiguity
  is a challenging requirement because deriving an exact formula for enforcing the
  contiguity of spatial units substantially increases the number of variables and
  constraints.


  Spatial contiguity has been modeled using mixed integer programming (MIP) and much
  effort has been expended on generating efficient constraints based on graph theory.
  For example, Zoltners and Shinha (1983) proposed a set of constraints using a tree
  structure to reflect the shortest path adjacency. The underlying logic was that
  areal units in a region maintain their connectedness in a tree structure when arbitrarily
  chosen seed units of the region at the kth level are allocated to a seed of the
  region when the predecessor of the seed, that is, a tree at the (k − 1)th level,
  is also allocated to the seed. Shirabe (2005, 2009) used flow-based contiguity constraints
  to construct a flow-based network for each region. The constraints build p-partitioned
  tree networks for a given number of areal units. Suppose a network is formed for
  each region, after which a sink in the constraints becomes the root of a shortest
  path tree. If a path has only one sink within a region and receives unit flows from
  the other nodes (spatial units), then the region is contiguous. Although this prescription
  can effectively reduce the number of variables and constraints, the model remains
  limited to relatively small problems unless the number of sinks consisting of regions
  is known a priori. Salazar-Aguilar, Ríos-Mercado, and Cabrera-Ríos (2011) proposed
  an integer quadratic programming model with subtour elimination constraints that
  guarantee territory connectivity or contiguity. This model is based on the main
  principle of first solving a relaxed version of the problem without contiguity constraints.
  If the solution contains subtours, then the appropriate subtour elimination constraints
  are added, and the problem is solved again. This process is repeated until a feasible
  solution is found. However, the obtained feasible solution may not be a global optimum.


  Third, a regionalization model, particularly when formulated in terms of MIP with
  contiguity constraints, may be non-tractable due to complexity. Duque, Church, and
  Middleton (2011) have presented three strategies for ensuring contiguity, along
  with the corresponding MIP models: (1) TreePRM, which adapts subtour elimination
  breaking constraints similar to those given by Salazar-Aguilar, Ríos-Mercado, and
  Cabrera-Ríos (2011); (2) OrderPRM, which uses ordered-area assignment variables
  to prevent cycles and ensure contiguity; and (3) FlowPRM, which uses unit flow constraints
  similar to those given by Shirabe (2005, 2009). Each strategy has its own distinct
  strengths in solving problems, but any p-regions problem that is formulated in the
  form of MIP belongs to a class of NP-hard problems, which means that the solution
  is ensured only for a limited number of spatial units regardless of the type of
  contiguity constraints. Any MIP model containing a set of constraints related to
  tree-, order-, or flow-based structures quickly reaches non-tractability with a
  small increase in the number of constraints and decision variables. For example,
  the model FLOWPRM, which is formulated based on Shirabe’s model (2005), is known
  to be the smallest model in terms of the number of constraints, but the computational
  effort required using commercial optimization software reveals that the model is
  tractable with optimality only for fewer than twenty-five units with a given level
  of p (for further details, see Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011). The difficulty
  may be due to the constraints that are imposed to prevent cycles when partitioned
  trees of each region are formed. A method for prespecifying the seeds of the regions
  (i.e., the initial target seeds) in the model may be introduced to improve the model’s
  tractability by reducing the complexity of the model through reducing the search
  space of the p-regions problems (Duque, Church, and Middleton 2011). However, such
  an approach can be validated only when the areas to be districted are known a priori.
  For this reason, many researchers have used efficient heuristics to solve large
  problems in practice by sacrificing the assurance of global optimality (e.g., Duque,
  Anselin, and Rey 2012).

  ### Formulating the p-functional Regions Problem (PFRP)

  <block id="4">

  Many districting or regionalization problems focus mainly on constructing districts
  or regions by grouping basic areal units without necessarily identifying the regional
  center. However, this article proposes a PFRP, in which functional centers are determined
  simultaneously with contiguous functional regions. The basic structure of the PFRP
  combines the principle of location–allocation models with the contiguity constraints
  inspired by Shirabe (2009) and Duque, Church, and Middleton (2011). As discussed,
  the location–allocation approach has been widely adopted in modeling districting
  problems because the basic areal units or demands are exhaustively and exclusively
  assigned (see Hess et al. 1965; Zoltners and Sinha 1983; Murray and Estivill-Castro
  1998), which is essential for identifying centers of regions within a set of flow-based
  contiguity constraints. The following notation is used in the PFRP:


  i = index of basic spatial units; i = 1, ... , n; i ∈ I;

  k = index of spatial units selected as functional centers of the region; k = 1,
  ... , n;

  p = the number of regions to be districted;

  cij = 1 if spatial units i and j are adjacent; 0 otherwise.

  Ni = { j | cij = 1 }; a set of spatial units that are adjacent to i;

  aik = the amount of geographic movement from spatial unit i to regional center k.


  The following decision variables are included in this model:


  yik = 1 if spatial unit i is included in region k; 0 otherwise.

  wik = 1 if spatial unit i is chosen as a sink of region k; 0 otherwise.

  fijk = the amount of unit flow from i to j in region k (fijk ≥ 0).


  Here, aik indicates the magnitude of the actual spatial interactions between the
  basic areal units and the regional centers, such as commuting and migration, to
  determine the functional regions, whereas fijk denotes the conceptual flows between
  basic spatial units in a contiguous region. Based on this notation and the corresponding
  decision variables, the PFRP can be modeled as follows:


  Maximize sum_k sum_i aik yik (1)


  Subject to:

  sum_k yik = 1, ∀ i. (2)


  wik ≤ yik, ∀ i, k. (3)


  sum_i wik ≤ 1, ∀ k. (4)


  sum_k sum_i wik = p. (5)


  fijk ≤ yik (n − p), ∀ i, j ∈ Ni, k. (6)


  fijk ≤ yjk (n − p), ∀ i, j ∈ Ni, k. (7)


  sum_{j∈Ni} fijk − sum_{j∈Ni} fjik ≥ yik − (n − p) wik, ∀ i, k. (8)


  yik ∈ {0, 1}, ∀ i, k. (9)


  wik ∈ {0, 1}, ∀ i, k. (10)


  fijk ≥ 0, ∀ i, j ∈ Ni, k. (11)


  The objective function maximizes the spatial interactions from the assigned areal
  units to a center within a region; the objective function is defined to capture
  the relationship between the center and its hinterlands instead of the relationship
  between all the spatial units assigned to the region because the PFRP determines
  the functional centers and delineates their sphere of influence simultaneously.
  Constraint (2) ensures that each spatial unit i is assigned to only one region k.
  These constraints require that all the spatial units are exclusively and exhaustively
  allocated to regions. Constraint (3) dictates that a sink can be assigned to the
  region k only when the spatial unit i is assigned to the same region. Constraint
  (4) requires that each region contains only one sink. Constraint (5) states that
  the total number of sinks is p (p < n). Constraints (4) and (5) together allow only
  p regions to be delimited. Constraints (6) and (7) ensure that unit flows can exist
  between the spatial units i and j if and only if both units are adjacent to and
  assigned to the same region k. The contiguity requirement for regionalization is
  established by constraint (8), which enforce the unit flows between the areal units
  assigned to the same region. If the areal unit i is not a sink (wik = 0), the areal
  unit i must supply at least one unit flow. If the areal unit i is a sink, the sink
  can have a nonnegative net flow up to (n − p − 1). Here ‘‘n − p − 1’’ represents
  the largest number of areal units that can be assigned to a region. Constraints
  (9) and (10) impose integer restrictions on the location and allocation decision
  variables. Constraint (11) ensures that fijk is nonnegative.


  Although the PFRP has a similar structure to the models of Shirabe (2009) and Duque,
  Church, and Middleton (2011) from a modeling perspective, there are several important
  differences. First, the objective function constructs p regions by maximizing the
  spatial interactions from the areal units to a functional center within a region
  without violating the contiguity requirement. Most minimization models do not necessarily
  require the number of regions to be specified, whereas the PFRP requires that p
  is explicitly specified as a constraint (see constraint [5]) because the PFRP is
  a maximization model. The similarity of this constraint to FLOWPRM may appear trivial,
  but combining this constraint with constraints (2), (3), and (4) narrows the solution
  space. The computational difficulty is thus reduced. The second difference between
  the PFRP and other models is that the former locates the functional centers through
  the term wik. The decision variables wik in the PFRP function differently in finding
  a solution for p = 3 compared to the same variables in other models, for example,
  FLOWPRM. The index k denotes an areal unit that is selected as a functional center.
  By contrast, in other models, k indicates the number of p-partitioned regions that
  are imposed as ordered numbers (k = 1, 2, 3, ... , p; see Shirabe 2009; Duque, Church,
  and Middleton 2011). The index k in wik in the PFRP ranges from 1 to n, instead
  of from 1 to p, because the model should select p centers from n areal units, as
  well as delineating the boundaries of the p regions. If k has a value between 1
  and p, then the PFRP cannot track the location of a region’s functional center.
  The main rationale of this treatment is to identify the sink and the functional
  center for each region during the regionalization process. This notational treatment
  allows the variable wik to be interpreted in a different manner in the PFRP. For
  example, w9_2 = 1 indicates that areal unit 9 is selected as a sink where all unit
  flows come together from all areal units within a region centered on areal unit
  2. By contrast, comparable variables in other models usually represent areal unit
  9 as a sink of the second delineated region among p regions. The variables w19_19
  and w23_23 (=1) indicate that areal units 19 and 23 are both functional centers
  and sinks for a region. Note that the selected functional center in the PFRP is
  not necessarily identical to the sink of the unit flow in each region because constraint
  (8) determines the sink of a region among the areal units in the region. In addition,
  considering that the goal of the objective function is to designate the selected
  spatial unit k as the functional center that maximizes spatial interactions from
  other areal units i within a region, the selected spatial unit k represents a central
  place or business center (i.e., a CBD) where geographical flows from other centers
  are highly concentrated.


  The logic of the PFRP in aggregating areal units into a set of functional regions
  can be explained by determining the dominant flows of the geographic inflows, outflows,
  and intraflows. If an areal unit receives substantial inflows from other units with
  small outflows, then this inflow-dominant unit is very likely to be the region’s
  functional center. By contrast, if an areal unit has dominant outflows to some vicinity,
  then this areal unit is likely to be part of the region’s hinterlands. As a special
  case, if an areal unit has substantial intraflows with small inflows and outflows,
  then the areal unit is considered a self-sustaining region that is not included
  in any other region. The main characteristic of the daily commuting flow is that
  geographic proximity in journey-to-work flows is a critical factor in delineating
  the space of economic activities and that most job opportunities are usually more
  accessible in a central areal unit that acts as a functional center and whose influential
  space diminishes with distance (Kim et al. 2012).

  ### Data

  <block id="6">

  We apply the PFRP to Seoul, South Korea. We consider Seoul for several reasons.
  First, the number of spatial units is appropriate for examining the solvability
  of p-regions problems. Seoul consists of twenty-five wards ("gu" in Korean). From
  previous research, an optimal solution is difficult to find in most districting
  models for a problem size of more than twenty-five areal units; problems involving
  sixteen units at a particular p level are often even harder to solve if there is
  a contiguity requirement in the model (Shirabe 2009; Duque, Church, and Middleton
  2011). Second, identifying functional regions in Seoul has been an important issue
  in geography, regional science, and planning because since the 1970s, the city’s
  labor and housing markets have changed, along with periodic changes in economic
  development plans. Historically, Seoul has evolved from a single central region
  into multiple functional regions over the last thirty years. Therefore, the regionalization
  of the city with an appropriate number of regions has been recognized as a critical
  task, not only for the effective administration and zoning of the city’s labor market
  but also for the strategic provision of Seoul’s transportation infrastructure (Song
  and Kim 2015). However, few studies have employed mathematical models to district
  and identify functional regions and their influential areas in terms of labor and
  services. To this end, the PFRP results can facilitate the decision-making process
  in terms of designating current CBDs and subcenters of Seoul as new centers of economic
  activity.


  For geographic flows, we consider the daily origin–destination commuting flows among
  Seoul’s twenty-five wards for the year 2005. Areal units 2 (Jung-gu, a conventional
  CBD), 23 (Gangnam-gu, a new CBD), and 19 (Yeongdeungpo-gu, a third CBD) are recognized
  as Seoul’s three major CBDs because these areal units host many firms and thus receive
  substantial inflows from other areal units. By contrast, areal units 11, 16, 20,
  21, and 24 show dominant outflows. With rapid advances in transportation systems
  and fluctuations in the housing market, these units have been developed as traditional
  residential areas (Song and Kim 2015). This raises the question of which units act
  as CBDs and how their influential boundaries can be delineated in terms of economic
  service areas of each unit. The daily commuting flows in Seoul (2005) support the
  findings of Song et al. (2012) who have identified the same CBDs in Seoul.

  The test cases in this study, from p = 2 to p = 23, are successfully solved with
  optimality. To solve the different cases, we use a CPLEX 12.1 with Intel’s Xeon
  Quad Core 3.2 GHz/3 GB RAM based on the Windows 7 operating system; the PFRP results
  of the problem cases are visualized using ESRI ArcGIS 9.3. The worst computational
  performance for the PFRP is observed at lower levels of p (2, 3, and 4), taking
  approximately sixteen to twenty-six hours; however, optimal solutions are found
  for the remaining 87 percent of the cases in less than thirty minutes. In fact,
  50 percent of the cases are solved in just a few minutes. This indicates that the
  PFRP can outperform other models in practice for moderate-sized regionalization
  problems regardless of the level of p.


  The optimal locations of the functional centers and districted regions for p ranging
  from 2 to 5 show the following observations. First, given the flow patterns, the
  interactions between areal units may be influenced by the behavior of commuters
  in Seoul who tend to live near CBDs to avoid a long commute to work. Note that the
  locations of the functional centers identified by the PFRP show how CBDs have emerged
  as Seoul has developed economically. For p = 2, Seoul is identified as a city with
  two distinct functional centers: (1) Jung-gu (unit 2), a conventional CBD, and (2)
  Gangnam-gu (unit 23), a newly established CBD. At p = 3, another regional CBD, Yeongdeungpo-gu
  (unit 19) is added to the western region of Seoul by dividing the area covered by
  Gangnam-gu at p = 2. The areal unit 19 is currently recognized as a subfunctional
  center in the southern region of Seoul, which is consistent with this districting
  result. Note that the major residential regions (units 11, 16, and 24) are nested
  within the three CBDs. At p = 4 and 5, the spatial units 16 and 25, respectively,
  are newly added, implying that these spatial units emerge as subfunctional centers
  from previous regionalization results, whereas the conventional CBD (unit 2) maintains
  its dominant position as a CBD regardless of the level of regionalization. This
  result suggests that labor markets become fragmented through the emergence of multiple
  centers.


  Second, regarding computational aspects, the inclusion relationship between selected
  sets of centers is observed at different levels of p. In addition, a set of optimal
  solutions for functional centers at p − 1 is found as a nested set of functional
  centers at p, or functional centers at a specific level of p can be a predefined
  set at p − 1. In the test cases, this inclusion relationship is observed from p
  = 2 to p = 20, with increasing p, in all cases except at p = 15. The nested-set
  relationship can be used to predict which units are potential candidates for functional
  centers. This characteristic motivates a potential solution strategy that may guarantee
  global optima based on the optimal solutions that are identified at a selected level
  of p. If any case with a lower p value suffers from computational complexity, then
  the search for the optimal solution at p can be initiated from the optimal solution
  sets at a higher level of p because the elimination of any candidates can tighten
  the solution space and thus help ensure global optima.


  Third, an ideal number of regions for delimiting the functional regions can be determined
  based on changes in the objective values. The objective value increases with p,
  indicating that the efficiency of the spatial interactions increases as regions
  are more regionalized in the model. Increments in the objective values with p may
  indicate natural breaks for effectively delimiting the functional regions. Significant
  changes are observed when p changes from 3 to 4 and 5 to 6, indicating that an ideal
  regional district corresponds to p = 3 or p = 5 in the case of Seoul. For p = 3,
  the three CBDs reflect the mid-2000s, when the southern and northern regions of
  Seoul developed as distinct economic areas, and the southern region was divided
  into two functional districts, namely functional centers 23 (a new CBD) and 19 (the
  third CBD; Song et al. 2012). As long as regions are districted in a nested structure
  with an increase in p, a discussion on the hierarchy of p regions is possible. For
  example, at p = 5, spatial units 2 and 23 are the top-tier centers, followed by
  spatial unit 19 as a second-tier center and spatial units 16 and 25 as subregional
  centers of 19 and 23, respectively. Based on central place theory, these regionalization
  patterns indicate service areas or hinterlands for the p-functional centers, as
  well as the regional hierarchy.

  ## Application to a Larger Problem: ATR

  ### Model Behavior of the PFRP

  <block id="9">

  The model’s computational time rapidly decreases as the number of p regions increases.
  Large computational times are only observed for lower levels of p with a higher
  level of complexity in terms of the numbers of constraints and variables. Thus,
  large computational times may be a problem if exact solutions are required at those
  levels. In terms of the model structure, note that constraints (6), (7), and (8)
  include the constant (n − p), which dictates the maximum number of allowable areal
  units constituting a region. In other words, a decrease in p increases the value
  of the constant, implying that the possibility of unit flows among the assigned
  spatial units also increases. In addition, an increase in p increases the objective
  value because most areal units have intraflows that far exceed the maximum outflows.
  In contrast, a decrease in p allows the intraflows of many areal units to be substituted
  for the largest, second largest, or third largest outflows.


  An interesting observation is that the set of centers selected at p − 1 is a subset
  of centers obtained for the range of p. This observation is due to the behavior
  of the objective function of the model. Basically, the model’s objective function
  searches for potential centers from either (1) areal units receiving large inflows
  from unselected areal units or (2) units with large intraflows. In theory, areal
  units with relatively small intraflows or large outflows can be considered potential
  centers. However, the model tends to designate areal units as potential centers
  if there are substantial differences between the magnitude of the intraflows and
  that of the largest (hereafter referred to as DIFF1) or second largest (hereafter
  referred to as DIFF2) outflows from a unit. These differences represent the impact
  on the objective value when a spatial unit is assigned to a center instead of being
  selected as a center. If only DIFF1 and DIFF2 are considered in the model, then
  the model has similar characteristics to the Nystuen–Dacey model in which centers
  are determined only by dominant flows from other nodes. However, note that the contiguity
  requirement of the model restricts the center to be within delimited regions. As
  a result, regions cannot be organized in a nonplanar type of hierarchy.


  This behavior of the model rarely changes when the level of p decreases or increases.
  The results indicate that it is very unlikely that areal units that are not selected
  as potential centers at p are selected as centers at p − 1. Using hypothetical data
  with six spatial units, a conceptual example shows how the PFRP functions in determining
  the locations of centers and assigning unselected areal units to the centers. As
  an initial step in understanding the behavior of the model, DIFF1 and DIFF2 are
  calculated by subtracting the largest and second-largest outflows, respectively,
  of an areal unit from its intraflows. For p = 5, areal unit 6, which has the smallest
  effect on the objective value in terms of DIFF1, maximizes the objective function
  when areal unit 6 is assigned to areal unit 5. Similarly, for p = 4, spatial unit
  2, for which DIFF1 corresponds to the second-smallest effect, becomes a unit to
  be dropped from a set of candidate centers at p = 5 and is assigned to center 1.
  Districting three regions is more complicated because the contiguity constraint
  must be considered. Although areal unit 5 has the third smallest effect after units
  2 and 6, areal unit 5 is already grouped with unit 6. If unit 5 is assigned to 3
  and unit 6 is assigned to 4, then the decrement in the objective value is 80. Alternatively,
  if both units 5 and 6 are assigned to unit 3, then the objective value decreases
  by 75, corresponding to a better grouping. However, the best case is found when
  assigning units 2, 4, and 6 to units 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This assignment
  results in the minimum decrement, thus maximizing the objective value. Finally,
  when a similar process is applied to p = 2, the maximum objective value is found
  once unit 2 is assigned to center 1 and units 4, 5, and 6 are grouped around center
  3.

  ### ATR

  <block id="10">

  Based on this hypothetical example and the empirical experiment, we propose the
  analytical target reduction (ATR) method to solve p-regions problems for a larger
  number of areal units. At a given p level, the global optimal or near-optimal solutions
  are found by considering the solution set found at the p + q level, rather than
  for all combinations of areal units (n) with functional centers. Here, q represents
  the ATR step size where 1 ≤ q ≤ (p − 1). ATR is based on the principle that the
  areal unit with the smallest contribution to the objective value during the delimitation
  of p regions is likely to have the smallest impact on the objective value when delineating
  (p − q) regions. Further, the centers that are selected at a level p are likely
  to be selected as centers at a lower level. This suggests that unselected areal
  units in the p-regions problem can be reasonably excluded from a set of potential
  centers when solving the (p − q)-regions problem.


  ATR proceeds by the following steps. First, the p = (n − q) case is solved. In this
  step, the set of potential seeds is I (|I| = n). The procedure can be started at
  an intermediate level of p, that is, with a high q value, but a relatively high
  q value may require significantly longer computation times. Second, unselected spatial
  units are eliminated from the set of potential centers and are added to the set
  of assigned spatial units U. Third, two additional constraints restrict the areal
  units in U to be noncenters and non-sinks for the next ATR case:

  yij = 0 ∀ i, j ∈ U;

  wij = 0 ∀ i, j ∈ U.

  Fourth, the previous steps are repeated until p = 2 or p < q is reached. This approach
  has considerable benefits because the complexity of the problem decreases significantly
  from nCp to pC(p − q) at the location level. The complexity of the allocation level
  decreases because of the narrowed search space at a given location level, although
  the contiguity structure among the areal units may influence the solution efficiency
  for a particular case. It should be noted that although a lower q value requires
  less computational effort in finding the optimal solution, the probability of finding
  the global optimum increases, along with the solution time, as the value of q increases.


  The performance of ATR can be improved by considering another important factor.
  Note that some areal units are consistently selected as functional centers regardless
  of the p level. In general, such units (denoted as the set S) have substantial intraflows
  (self-sustaining spatial units) or inflows from other areal units. An areal unit
  with dominant inflows from other units can be regarded as a functional center. Thus,
  the solution space can be reduced and the computational efficiency improved by considering
  one or two areal units as centers regardless of the p level. Applying this concept
  to ATR requires the following constraints:

  yii = 1 ∀ i ∈ S;

  wii = 1 ∀ i ∈ S.


  Finally, note that an exception may occur when ATR is applied with q = 1. This exception
  occurs under three conditions: (1) the largest outflows of an areal unit are to
  a center that is not adjacent to the areal unit (which is defined as the first law
  of geography), (2) no unit flow route is ensured from the areal unit to the center,
  and (3) areal units that similarly impact the objective value are distributed around
  the center. This problem can be resolved using a higher q value.


  The ATR model substantially reduces the computational time for all cases, without
  losing optimality. The longest computational time is less than five minutes in tested
  cases, with most cases requiring only 1 percent of the solution time of the original
  model. In addition, the ATR model shows a 99 percent reduction in the number of
  iterations relative to the original model. These results are due to significant
  reductions in complexity at each location level, that is, the ATR model selects
  p − 1 functional centers from p predetermined centers. If a more conservative approach
  is required, then a higher q value can be used and computational times remain reasonable.
  ATR is a promising approach for large-size problems when optimal solutions are desired.
  This approach is particularly applicable to regionalization problems involving spatial
  interactions such as migration and commuting with a short-distance tendency (Ravenstein
  1885; Tobler 1987) or interactions derived from the central place theory (Christaller
  1966).

  ### Application of ATR: South Carolina Case Study

  <block id="11">

  Here, we test the PFRP model by incorporating ATR for a large data set, namely forty-six
  counties in South Carolina using journey-to-work data from the 2000 US Census. As
  with the previous p-regions models, the MIP version of the PFRP is limited to a
  set of approximately twenty-five areal units for solving the problem with optimality.
  Thus, we apply ATR to assess its impacts on the solution capability of the original
  PFRP. To predetermine the initial seeds, the spatial pattern of interactions among
  the forty-six counties in terms of intraflows and inflows is used as a reference
  when adding the constraints that fix certain units as centers. Two counties (Greenville
  and Richland) show dominant intraflows as well as inflows. In contrast, there are
  several counties in the southwestern and northern areas that show minimal intraflows
  and/or inflows. Intuitively, these small counties are clearly not likely to be functional
  centers, whereas the two counties with dominant intraflows are.


  Applying ATR with q = 1 sequentially from p = 44 to p = 2, optimal solutions for
  thirty-six cases (84 percent) are derived for p = 9 to p = 44, for which the computational
  time ranges from several seconds to a few hours. Some cases terminated due to memory
  problems, with a gap ranging from 3.78 percent to 41.7 percent. However, despite
  the gap, the objective values are global optima, which were verified through enumeration-based
  results for p = 2–8. Most of the excluded spatial units are counties with minimal
  intraflows or inflows from other counties, whereas the top ten counties satisfying
  these criteria remain in the set of potential centers until the sequential process
  reaches p = 9.


  The ATR approach is appropriate, not only for the PFRP but also for other districting
  model variants. At p = 3, South Carolina is districted with three regions centered
  at Greenville, Richland, and Charleston counties, which have the three largest populations
  in South Carolina. At p = 4, Horry county, which ranks fourth in terms of intraflows,
  is added as a functional center by annexing some neighboring counties from regions
  covered by Richland and Charleston. At p = 5 and 6, Spartanburg and Beaufort counties
  are added as regional centers. These three counties show dominant intraflows but
  small inflows and are grouped with only a few neighboring counties, indicating that
  these counties are more self-sustaining regions than regions with functional centers
  in Greenville, Richland, and Charleston counties. The regional delimitation of South
  Carolina can be explained using a combination of central location theory and labor-shed
  regions. Richland County, which includes Columbia, the capital of South Carolina,
  is a major functional center for administrative services. The most populous counties,
  Greenville and Charleston, have experienced rapid population growth in conjunction
  with a corresponding increase in job opportunities.


  The most appropriate level of p for regionalization can be identified from the variation
  of the objective function values with p. The most significant increment in the objective
  function is clearly observed as p changes from 3 to 4, indicating that the optimal
  number of regions is three. If more regions are considered, then five regions are
  reasonable because of an alternative natural break found in the variation in the
  objective function values from p = 5 to p = 6. In terms of an urban hierarchy, the
  first-tier consists of three centers (Greenville, Richland, and Charleston counties),
  and the second-tier comprises Horry and Spartanburg counties as subfunctional centers.

  ## Concluding Remarks

  <block id="12">

  This article considers a flow-based regionalization problem (PFRP) in terms of an
  MIP formulation that determines p functional centers and aggregates n areal units
  into p contiguous regions based on spatial interactions. This PFRP model is based
  on classical location theory, which assumes that a region consists of functional
  centers that are often referred to as central places, urban centers, or CBDs, depending
  on geographic scales, surrounded by a hinterland that is linked through spatial
  interaction with the centers. Spatial interactions, including inflows, outflows,
  and intraflows, are key to transforming areal units into p-functional regions, where
  the pattern of spatial interactions may represent an area of commuting or similar
  economic flows. The PFRP only groups commuting flows among regions with a set of
  functional centers. However, note the empirical observation that the functional
  regions formed by a pattern of spatial interactions among regions, such as commuting
  flows, are also governed by other political or economic activities.


  There are three main differences between the PFRP presented here and other p-regions
  models. First, the PFRP fundamentally belongs to a class of location–allocation
  models with a contiguity requirement. The models in Duque, Church, and Middleton
  (2011) and Shirabe (2009) are basically allocation models with explicit contiguity
  requirements, but these models do not identify the significant areal unit within
  each region. In contrast, the PFRP determines the locations of functional centers
  by considering the magnitude of spatial interactions among areal units, while also
  ensuring contiguity. Second, the PFRP is a maximization model for districting regions.
  Most other p-regions models focus on minimizing dissimilarity as an objective function
  rather than maximizing similarity among spatial units. The PFRP generally maintains
  compact shapes because the most flows, such as commuting, are inherently dictated
  by physical distance, such that spatial contiguity is satisfied in capturing the
  spatial pattern of commuting flows. Third, in terms of model performance, the PFRP
  provides more efficient solvability than previous models. The PFRP model can be
  applied to problems with up to thirty areal units with no additional constraints,
  which is sufficient to validate many regionalization problems with optimality. Finally,
  the PFRP combined with ATR can be applied to relatively large problems (e.g., forty-six
  counties in South Carolina).


  From a planning perspective, ATR is useful for situations in which the decision-making
  process requires that an appropriate level of p be determined. Although this approach
  may not guarantee optimality in extremely complex cases, ATR is potentially applicable
  to any p-regions problem with criteria involving geographical movements among the
  regions, which is exemplified here in the cases of Seoul and South Carolina. In
  particular, ATR is effective in reinforcing optimality for small or moderate size
  problems if an exact solution is required. Obviously, ATR may have limited applicability
  for a large number of areal units, which is still the main issue in using a mathematical
  programming approach to solve regionalization problems. In this regard, future research
  should be two-pronged. First, the suitability and effectiveness of ATR should be
  evaluated for use with complex data sets, followed by the development of heuristic
  techniques for practical applications (Duque, Romas, and Surinach 2007).
